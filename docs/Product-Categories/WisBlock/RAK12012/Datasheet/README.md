## Specifications

### Overview

#### Mounting

The RAK12012 WisBlock Heart Rate Sensor Module can be mounted to the IO slot of the [WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) board. **Figure 1** shows the mounting mechanism of the RAK12012 on a WisBlock Base module.

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into five parts. It shows the chipset of the module and discusses the pinouts and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical and mechanical parameters that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK12012 WisBlock Heart Rate Sensor Module.

#### Chipset

| Vendor           | Part number |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Analog Devices | MAX30102    |


#### Pin Definition

The RAK12012 WisBlock Heart Rate Sensor comprises a standard WisBlock connector. The WisBlock connector allows the RAK12012 module to be mounted to a WisBlock Base board. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 3**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
- **I2C** related pins: **INT**,**3V3_S**, and **GND** are connected to WisIO connector.
- **3V3_S** voltage output from the WisBlock Base that powers the RAK12012 module can be controlled by the WisBlock Core via WB_IO2 (WisBlock IO2 pin). This makes the module ideal for low-power IoT projects since the WisBlock Core can totally disconnect the power of the RAK12012 module.

#### Schematic Diagram

##### Power Supply

**Figure 6** shows the MAX30102 power supply. The IC uses 1.8&nbsp;V as voltage supply source generated by SGM2019-1.8YN5G/TR (LDO). The VLED+ has a different dedicated power supply coming from the 3V3_S of the WisBlock Base board.

/>


##### Voltage Level Transfer

The MAX30102 IO voltage is 1.8&nbsp;V and the CPU module voltage is 3.3&nbsp;V, so the voltage level transfer is needed. Pull-up Resistor for I2C_SCL and I2C_SDA already exist on WisBlock Base boardÔºåso there is no need to connectÔºàNCÔºâon IO module such as RAK12012.

##### MAX30105EFD+T Circuit

INT is an active-low interrupt (Open-Drain). This needs to be connected to an external voltage with a pull-up resistor **R7**.
