# RAK5860 WisBlock NB-IoT Interface Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK5860 WisBlock Connect module is designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way and must be combined with a WisBlock Core and a Base module.

The RAK5860 is a module designed to work with the RAK5005-O baseboard and it provides wireless communication (LTE Cat M1, LTE Cat NB2) to the final application. This module supports the LTE-FDD network and supports half-duplex operation in the LTE network. It also provides optional GNSS functionality.

For debugging purposes, a Micro-USB connector is used for sending AT commands, data transmission, and receiving GNSS NMEA output. Once the module is integrated with the RAK5005-O baseboard, the internal UART port of the module is connected through the IO connector to a WisBlock Core module.

### Features

* Quectel BG77 with LTE Cat M1, LTE cat NB2, and GNSS
* IPEX connectors for the LTE and GPS antenna
* Micro-USB connector
* Nano SIM and ESIM options
* Status Indication LEDs
* Power Supply: 2.6-4.2&nbsp;V, typical supply voltage 3.3&nbsp;V
* Module size: 25&nbsp;mm x 35&nbsp;mm

#### Schematic Diagram

The following sections will describe the schematic of the RAK5860 module, which include:

* Turn on/off Module
* IO Connector
* Voltage-level Translator
* SIM Card Circuit
* USB Connector
* Status Indication LEDs
* Main Antenna
* GNSS Antenna

##### Turn On/Off Mechanism

**Figure 7** shows a circuit to allow the turn on or to turn off the module. By default, the internal Quectel BG77 module is in power-off mode, it can be turned on by driving WIS_PWRKEY to a high state (positive digital pulse) for a period of 500-1000&nbsp;ms.

Driving WIS_PWRKEY high for 650-1500&nbsp;ms, the module will execute a power-down procedure after WIS_PWRKEY is released, then enter off mode.

Alternatively, you can send a command **`AT+QPOWD`** command that turns off the internal Quectel BG77 module.

##### Voltage-level Translator

Within the BG77, all interfaces are designed to work with 1.8&nbsp;V level. RAK5860 features a voltage-level translator to down-convert the 3.3&nbsp;V coming from the WisBlock Core module. **Figure 10** shows the design of the internal voltage-level translator.

  width="40%"
  caption="3.3 V to 1.8 V voltage-level translator"
/>

* When WIS_TX is high (3.3&nbsp;V), the NPN triode is turned off, BG77_RX is pulled high (1.8&nbsp;V).

* When WISTX is low (0&nbsp;V), the NPN triode is turned on, BG77 RX is low (0&nbsp;V).

* When BG77_TX is low (0&nbsp;V), the NPN triode is turned on, WIS_RX is low (0&nbsp;V)

* When BG77TX is high (1.8&nbsp;V), the NPN triode is turned off, and WIS RX is pulled high (3.3&nbsp;V)

:::tip üìù NOTE:
VDD_EXT is 1.8&nbsp;V, from BG77 internal regulator, BG77 pin 21.
:::

##### SIM Card Circuit

The RAK5860 module only supports the 1.8&nbsp;V ESIM/SIM card. **Figure 12** shows the SIM interface circuit. By default, a Nano SIM card is used, and eSIM is not mounting. To offer good ESD protection, a TVS diode array is added to the SIM card circuitry.

##### USB Connector

The RAK5860 module provides a Micro-USB connector for connection with a host device. The USB data lines USB+ and USB- are connected directly to the BG77. The VBUS line can be used for USB connection detection.

To offer good ESD protection, a TVS diode array is added to the USB connector circuit.

##### Main Antenna

The RAK5860 module‚Äôs main antenna has a reserve œÄ-type matching circuit for better RF performance, and a U.FL connector is used for the main antenna.

##### GNSS Antenna

The RAK5860 module is designed with an active antenna. The 3V3_S is from the WisIO connector, and a U.FL connector is used for the GNSS antenna. **Figure 18** shows the GNSS antenna circuit.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
3V3_S is controlled by IO2 of WisBlock (P1.02 of NRF52840). For the active GPS antenna to work, set the pin to HIGH in your code.
