## Product Description

**LX200V50** is a Power Line Communication (PLC) module based on Qualcomm QCA7550 System-on-Chip (SoC). QCA7550 is a MAC/PHY transceiver module that meets the HPAV2 standard. It is designed to bridge multi-stream Ethernet content from a powerline network to an Ethernet 802.3 network. The PLC's specific MAC manages network admission and service flows to maximize the Quality of Service (QoS) over the powerline network.
