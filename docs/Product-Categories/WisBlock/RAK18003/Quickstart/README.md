## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

RAK18003 is an interposer module, part of the **WisBlock Audio Series**.

For more information about RAK18003, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

RAK18003 module can be connected to the IO slot of the WisBlock Base to communicate with the WisBlock Core. Always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for the IO slot is properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [WisBlock Base board assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

  caption="LoRa and BLE antennas connection to RAK4631 module"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock module is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

::: tip üìù NOTE
- If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts.
- RAK18003 uses I2C communication lines, and it can cause possible conflict, especially on other WisBlock Modules connected to Slot A to D of the WisBlock Base.
:::

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the WisBlock Base board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.

### Software Configuration and Examples

**RAK18003** is an interposer module, part of the **WisBlock Audio Series**. Its design allows multiple WisBlock Audio modules to be used together on a single IO slot. It consists of two IO expanders (TPT29555-TS5R), one signal switch (5223YWQ10/TR), and connectors where other WisBlock Audio modules can be interfaced. It also has a usable TF card slot. **RAK18003** module can be used with **RAK18030 PDM Microphone** or **RAK18060 Amplifier Module**. Their sample applications are detailed below.

#### Sample Code Test of the RAK18030 Module with RAK18003 Interposer Module

1. To test the **RAK18003 (Audio Interposer)** with **RAK4631 (WisBlock Core)** and **RAK18030 (PDM Microphone)**, you need to assemble them first, as shown in **Figure 7**.
