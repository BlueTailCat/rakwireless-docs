The ChirpStack, previously known as the LoRaServer project, provides open-source components for building LoRaWAN networks. Like the case of TTN, the RAK10702 WisBlock Indoor Comfort Node is located in the periphery and transmits the data to the backend servers through a LoRaWAN gateway. Learn more about [ChirpStack ‚§¥Ô∏è](https://www.chirpstack.io/).

:::tip üìù NOTE:

In this guide, it is assumed that you are using a RAK LoRaWAN gateway, such as RAK7249. The gateway must be configured and registered previously to a Chirpstack deployment. For further information, check the Chirpstack documents for more details.

:::

In this section, you need the following requirements:

  1. A ChirpStack deployment
  2. Access to a LoRaWAN gateway registered at the ChirpStack server
  3. Chirpstack already setup with a Network Server and Service Profile
  3. Serial Port Tool
  4. RAK10702 WisBlock Indoor Comfort Node

### Decoding the Payload

#### Cayenne LPP Data Format

The Cayenne Low Power Payload (LPP) provides a convenient and easy way to send data over LPWAN networks such as LoRaWAN. The Cayenne LPP is compliant with the payload size restriction, which can be lowered down to 11 bytes, and allows the device to send multiple sensor data at a time or split into several frames.

The Data Channel uniquely identifies each sensor or actuator within a device. The acceptable range is from 0 to 64. The device developer is responsible to assign a unique channel for each of the device's sensor and actuator and conform to it across the device life cycle.

Data Types are based on the IPSO Alliance Smart Objects Guidelines, which identify each data type with an "Object ID". However, as shown below, a conversion is made to fit the Object ID into a single byte.

```
LPP_DATA_TYPE = IPSO_OBJECT_ID - 3200
```

Each data type can use 1 or more bytes to send the data similar to the following table:

| Type               | IPSO | LPP | Hex | Data Size | Data Resolution per bit                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ---- | --- | --- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Digital Input      | 3200 | 0   | 0   | 1         | 1                                                                                               |
| Digital Output     | 3201 | 1   | 1   | 1         | 1                                                                                               |

#### Data Format Used

The packet data is based on the Cayenne LPP packet format, but it has additional channel ID's that are not in the default Cayenne LPP specification. This was required because some sensor data did not fit into any of the existing channel ID's.    
The data format uses the following sensor types:

| Data                     | Channel No. | Channel ID | Length        | Comment                                                         | Required Module   | Decoded Field Name |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
