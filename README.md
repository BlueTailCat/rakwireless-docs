# RAKwireless
**RAKwireless** is an IoT company that aims to bring all-in-one IoT solutions to the global community ranging from end node sensors to cloud computing. It is committed to delivering practical and effective IoT solutions, hence, provides high-quality IoT devices.

## RAK Documentation Center
RAKwireless has a documentation center where it contains a catalog of comprehensive documents to explore and delve deeper into the potential of RAK products on the Internet of Things (IoT).

The **RAK Documentation Center** aims to assist every **developer**, **entrepreneur**, and **enthusiast** alike in building their new project and implementing IoT technology solutions. Aside from the documents of the RAK products, it contains a list of curated projects and tutorials and other supplemental information to start a new project as easy as it can be.

The files are sorted per device for a more convenient experience:
- **Quick Start Guide**: a set of concise instructions in installing and deploying your device with only its core functionality in mind
- **Datasheet**: comprehensive information on the device components and functionality with their technical and specific characteristics
- **Knowledge Hub**: a catalog of supplemental articles and tutorials, and a compilation of pre-answered questions about the device and the technology utilized to narrow the common knowledge gaps for a more thorough understanding


### Open-Source
RAK decided to make its documentation center open-source to extend its scope where experts and enthusiasts collaborate and operate at their full potential. Also, anyone can inspect for errors and inconsistencies that are beneficial to the documentation center and to the other users as well. Hence, the decision is made with these three in mind:

* **Collaboration**
* **Transparency**
* **Adoption**
