# WisGate OS User Manual

## Overview

This document describes the functionality of the WisGateOS in detail. The interface builds on top of OpenWRT and all gateway products of the RAK72xx line share it. It gives instructions on configuring WAN, the LoRa Packet Forwarder, and MQTT Bridge. It explains how to do system monitoring, update the firmware, and reset the device. Last but not least, it provides information on using the Built-in LoRa Server. This guide functions as a reference for several products with similar functionality. Thus, some sections will apply to certain products and not others. 

## Gateway Start-Up

::: tip üìù NOTE
Make sure all the antennas are connected before powering the Gateway. 
:::


For RAK7258 and RAK7268, use the included adapter. RAK7249 and RAK7289 come with a PoE injector, which you need to connect to the grid on one side and to the gateway on the other (Ethernet cable not included). 

The gateway comes configured in such a way that you can use either the Ethernet port or the Wi-Fi in AP mode to connect to the Management platform. 

In both modes, you can access the Management UI via a web browser pointing to the IP address of the gateway (check your router DHCP list). Alternately, the IP Address (`192.168.230.1`) is preconfigured as the one to use to access the device provided you are directly connected to it. 

### Wi-Fi AP Mode 

By default, the gateway is configured to work in Access Point (AP) mode. It has the following parameters: 

- **Wi-Fi**: SSID: RAK72XX_xxxx (no password is required to connect via Wi-Fi) 
- **Web UI**: Connect via a browser to the IP address assigned to the gateway which is `192.168.230.1` by default. You should see the login window, as shown in **Figure 1**. Use the credentials below: 
  - UI user: **root** 
  - UI password: **root** 

### WAN port (DHCP IP) mode 

Connect the Ethernet cable to the port marked **ETH** and the other end to your router. Use the same credentials for the Web UI as for AP mode.

/>

## Web Management Platform

After you have entered the correct credentials, you can start exploring the configuration and monitoring interface of the gateway.

### Status

This is where statistics about the Gateway behavior can be monitored in real time.

#### Overview

The page consists of several areas where you can see the overview of some metrics and basic information about the gateway upon logging in the browser displays the page shown in **Figure 2**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos/main/2.overview.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Overview Page"
/>

- **Received**: Shows the total number of uplink LoRa messages received by the gateway. Here are displayed not only messages from devices connected to the gateway directly but from any device that is within the coverage of the gateway and transmitting LoRa messages.
- **Transmitted**: Shows the total number of downlink LoRa messages sent by the gateway.
- **Active Nodes**: Shows the number of active LoRa nodes within the LoRaWAN gateway's coverage. Those that have sent no data for more than 10 min are discarded from the count. 
- **Busy Nodes**: Shows the number of busy nodes within the LoRaWAN gateway's coverage (Nodes with an average message spacing of less than 100s.).
- **Duty Cycle of the LoRa Channel**: The graph represents the Duty Cycle load by frequency channel (Data is kept for the last 12 hours). The minimum resolution along the time axis is 100s. Each value is an average of over 100s. The values are color code ‚Äì green to red, low to high.
- **RSSI & SNR**: These graphs show how many of the total amount packets have an RSSI/SNR value within a certain range. This is also shown in a pie chart to the side of the graphs.
- **Uplink Traffic**: The field shows the packet per minute rate as a function of time and airtime(s) per minute as a function of time. Above the graphs, you can see the color-coding of the different Spreading Factors, where the actual height of the values is a sum of all the packets overall spreading factors for the time sample.
- **Downlink Traffic**: Shows the packet per minute rate as a function of time and airtime(s) per minute as a function of time. Above the graphs, you can see the color-coding of the different Spreading Factors, where the actual height of the values is a sum of all the packets overall spreading factors for the time sample.
- **System**: Shows some basic information about the gateway such as hostname, model, serial number, firmware version, local time, uptime of the gateway, load average, and GPS location.
- **Memory**: There are bars in this section that show how much is the Total Memory Available, Free and Buffered Memory is. 
- **LoRa Network Server**: You can see the statistics for your network server. The number of associated LoRa Nodes, Uplink, Downlink, Received Join, and Rejected Join, those types of packets all have a numerical value associated with them. Additionally, you can check the Uptime and whether you have the MQTT Integration running.
- **Network**: Shows parameters and status for IPv4 network interface that is active in the gateway. Some of the parameters are Type, Interface IP, Netmask, Gateway, DNS1, DNS2, etc.
- **Cellular**: This shows the connection status of the gateway‚Äôs cellular together with the corresponding Network ID and the parameters of the Sim card (ICCID, IMSI, Phone number). (*optional*)
- **Wireless**: Shows parameters and status for the Wi-Fi. Some of the parameters are connectivity status, signal strength, and IP addressing parameters for both AP and Client interfaces.
- **Dynamic DNS**: The field shows the Dynamic DNS configuration if configured, otherwise, there will be a message saying **There is no service configured.**

#### LoRaWAN Packet Logger

This is where a log of the LoRa messages is shown in real-time. There are several options for filtering as well as the possibility to download the statistics in a file. There is also a message summary: Total, Uplink, and Downlink.

By selecting a particular packet (by a single click on the packet), you get an extended window with the detailed metadata for the packet as well as some RF parameters. In addition, there is a graph area below the packets list, where is shown the **Air Time** for each of the nodes that have packets detected by the packet logger and also the load per frequency channel.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos/main/3.packet-logger.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="LoRaWAN Packet Logger Page"
/>

Filter the packets by choosing any of the following:

- **Type**: Filter the packets by type. By default, all the types of packets are shown. When a certain type is selected, the logger will show only this type of packet and the others will be ignored. The possible options are the following:
    - Join Request
    - Join Accept
    - Unconfirmed Data Up
    - Unconfirmed Data Down
    - Confirmed Data Up
    - Confirmed Data Down
- **DevAddr**: Filter the packets by the node address. Only packets from the selected node will show in the logger and the others will be ignored.
- **Hide CRC_ERR packet**: When it is selected, no **CRC** check error message will be displayed.

#### System Log

On this page, you can see the complete system logs. It is useful mainly for debugging purposes. The System Log reports both system information and actual data from LoRa frames coming from the end nodes.

#### Firewall

The Firewall settings won‚Äôt be discussed in detail in this document due to the large variety of settings to be configured. This document will give a simple overview of the interface instead.

The Firewall page has a few separated tabs:

- **General Settings**: This tab has two fields. The first field is the **General Settings** tab where general settings can be done: **Enable/Disable SYN-flood protection**, **Drop invalid packets on/off**, and **Input/Output/Forward settings**. The second field is for Zones settings where you can set up separate settings for the zones.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos/main/15.general-settings.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="General Settings Tab"
/>

- **Port Forwards**: This tab allows you to set up the port forwards. Port forwarding allows remote computers on the Internet to connect to a specific computer or service within the private LAN. In the tab, there is a register with the port forwards that are already set up, and below is a couple of fields to set up a new port forward. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos/main/16.port-tab.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Port Forwards Tab"
/>

- **Traffic Rules**: This tab allows you to set up the traffic rules. Traffic rules define policies for packets traveling between different zones, for example, to reject traffic between certain hosts or to open WAN ports on the router. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos/main/17.traffic-rules.png"
  width="100%"

  width="100%"
  caption="Multi WAN Tab"
/>

### Channel Plan

In the Channel Plan, you can set up the operating frequency of the gateway. These frequency channels are the ones that the gateway will use to both receiving and transmitting from/to LoRa nodes. The first field on the page is for the **Region** that the gateway is set to. You can also change the region, corresponding to the frequency band for their country. The other modifications that can be done are **LoRaWAN Public** (on/off), **Multi-SF LoRa Channel**, **Standard Lora Channel**, and **FSK Channel**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos/main/20.channel-plan.png"

### LoRa Network

#### Network Settings

Here, the working mode of the gateway is set up. In the **LoRaWAN Network Settings** field, you can find the **Gateway EUI** and set the **Mode** (Packet Forwarder, Basics Station, and Network Server) and **Log Level** (Error, Warning, Notice, Info, and Debug). Depending on the chosen mode, the set of available settings change. 

##### Packet Forwarder

- **General Setup**: All the needed variables for configuration are as follows:
  - **Protocol**: You can choose what protocol will be used by the gateway.
  - **Server Address**: The URL of the LoRa Server (in the example: the EU TTN address).
  - **Server Port Up/Down**: These are the ports of the LoRa Server that are going to be used for inbound and outbound traffic.
  - **Push Timeout (ms)**: The time delay for the server response after sending uplink data.
  - **Statistic Interval (s)**: The time interval of how often statistics are pushed to the server.
  - **Keepalive Interval (s)**: the interval of which the gateway send data to make sure that the server is aware that the gateway is online. For example, the MQTT bridge will unsubscribe from the topics after a certain period of inactivity.
  - **Automatic data recovery**: A feature that allows LoRa frames to be stored on the SD card (provided there is one in the slot). If the gateway loses connection to the LoRa Network Server, upon restoring the connection, the buffered messages will be forwarded, so no data is lost. This is done in blocks of 8 (FIFO) until all are cleared from the buffer.
  - **DGRAM MTU**: The size of the maximum transmission unit. Default is 1400.
  - **Auto-restart Threshold**: This variable defines how many times the Keepalive Interval can expire before the Packet Forwarder restarts.
  - **Is LoRaWAN Network**: When NO is chosen, frames that are not compliant with the LoRaWAN specification will be forwarded (in case of a proprietary LoRa Server solution). By default, YES is selected and non LoRaWAN packets are dropped.
