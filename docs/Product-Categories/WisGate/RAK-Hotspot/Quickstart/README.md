### Backup your microSD Card

Backing up your microSD Card is very important as this contains your RAK Hotspot identity. If the card is lost or damaged, you may lose access to the Helium network, and require payment of a new add gateway fee. **Keep this backup card in a safe place**.

You should only backup after adding the hotspot to your Helium account, and ideally once it has fully synced.

To backup, power off the RAK Hotspot and follow [backup instructions](../Backup/).
