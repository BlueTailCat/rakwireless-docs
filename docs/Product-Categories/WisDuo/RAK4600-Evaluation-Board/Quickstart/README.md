## Configuring RAK4600

You can configure your RAK4600 Evaluation Board by sending AT Commands either through BLE or through micro USB.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
For the full list of AT Commands available for configuring your RAK4600, refer to the [AT Command Manual](../../AT-Command-Manual/).
:::

### Through Micro USB

1. As mentioned in [Checking Device Logs](#checking-device-logs), if you want to use the RAK4600 Evaluation Board through UART, you should connect the RAK4600 to Windows PC, as shown in **Figure 7**.


<rk-img

  width="55%"
  caption="RAK4600 Evaluation Board to Windows PC Connection"
/>

2. Try to send a simple AT command to RAK4600 to get the current firmware‚Äôs version by sending the command below using the RAK Serial Port Tool. Similarly, you can send other AT commands of RAK4600 in the same way.

```sh
at+version
```

  width="45%"
  caption="AT command for Firmware Version"
/>

### Through BLE

1. To configure the RAK4600 through BLE, download and install the **nRF Connect for Mobile**. This tool is developed by Nordic Semiconductor and is available on the App Store and Google Play Store.

### Bluetooth Connection Modes

There are three BLE modes in RAK4600 from the firmware V3.0.0.6: the **Peripheral Mode**, the **Central Mode**, and the **Beacon Scan Mode**. You can change the work mode of RAK4600‚Äôs BLE using the commands provided below, which is defined in the [AT Command Manual](../../RAK4600-Module/AT-Command-Manual/).

```sh
at+set_config=ble:work_mode:X:Y
```
**Description:** Set the work mode for BLE.
- **X** - 0: BLE peripheral mode, 1: BLE central mode. 2: Beacon scan mode.
- **Y** - 0: normal range, 1: BLE long range.

#### BLE Peripheral Mode

For the Peripheral Mode, you can scan RAK4600‚Äôs BLE and connect with it using your mobile device.

#### BLE Central Mode

For the Central Mode, RAK4600‚Äôs BLE will not broadcast, so that your mobile devices will not be able to scan it. This is very useful if you want to make the RAK4600 act as a BLE Gateway wherein BLE Sensor Nodes (up to 20 Devices) can send sensor data.

#### Beacon Scan Mode

For the Beacon Scan mode, RAK4600 can scan around the Beacon signal. It is useful for a Beacon use case like iBeacon.

#### RAK4600 BLE Default Settings

By default, the RAK4600 Evaluation Board will work on **Peripheral Mode.** In this mode, you can configure it through BLE, including DFU. It should be noted that after resetting the RAK4600, you have only 60 seconds to establish a connection with your Mobile Device through BLE based on its power consumption settings. If no connection has been established within 60 seconds, the RAK4600 BLE signal will not be broadcasted, and it will enter power-saving mode. On the other hand, there is no limitation once you are already connected with the RAK4600's BLE.

If you set the RAK4600 to work in Central Mode, the RAK4600 will work first on Peripheral Mode for 30 seconds, and if no connection is established after 30 seconds, it will automatically work in **Central Mode.** In this mode, the BLE signal of the RAK4600 will stop broadcasting and will not be visible on your mobile devices up until you change the work mode to peripheral mode or reset the RAK4600 again.


### Burning the Firmware

If you want to get a pre-compiled firmware instead of compiling the source code by yourself, you can find the latest firmware on the **[RAK downloads](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/RAK4600/Firmware/)**.


#### Flash the firmware using DAPLink and RAKDAP

Refer to <a href="../../../../../Product-Categories/Accessories/RAKDAP1-Flash-and-Debug-Tool/Overview/#rakdap1-flash-and-debug-tool/" target="_blank">RAKDAP1 Flash and Debug Tool</a>.

### Upgrading Firmware through DFU using BLE

1. Download the DFU package of the [**RAK4600 Evaluation Board**](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/LoRa/RAK4600/Firmware/History-Release-Version/DFU-Package/), and save it on your mobile phone.

2. Make sure the Bluetooth on your mobile is turned on. Open the **nRF Connect** Mobile application, and you will see all BLE devices in range in the scan list.

3. Press the reset button on the RAK4600 and wait for a couple of seconds. Look for a BLE Device named "**RUI-...**" in the scan list of the app. Connect to this device and click on "**Secure DFU Service**".

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 This will be only visible for 60 seconds. More information about Bluetooth connection guide can be found in the [BLE Connection Modes](#bluetooth-connection-modes) section.

8. After connecting, select the DFU Icon. On the Select file type, choose **Distribution packet (ZIP)** and press OK. This will then prompt you to select the zip file of the firmware that you have downloaded.

9. The DFU application automatically starts to upgrade the firmware of your RAK4600 through DFU over BLE. After upgrading, the application restarts the RAK4600, and the DFU mode is disabled. You can now use the RAK4600 with the latest firmware.
