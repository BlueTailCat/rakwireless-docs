# RAK7289V2/RAK7289CV2 Supported LoRa Network Servers

## AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN

Execute the following steps to set up your AWS account and permissions:

### Set up Roles and Policies in IAM

#### Add an IAM Role for CUPS Server

Adding an IAM role will allow the Configuration and Update Server (CUPS) to handle the wireless gateway credentials.

This procedure needs to be done only once, but must be performed before a LoRaWAN gateway tries to connect with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN.

1. Go to the [IAM Roles](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles) page on the IAM console.
2. Choose **Create role**.
3. On the Create Role page, choose **Another AWS account**.
4. Enter your **Account ID**, then select **Next**.
5. In the search box next to the **Filter Policies**, type **_AWSIoTWirelessGatewayCertManager_**.
   - If the search results show the policy named **_AWSIoTWirelessGatewayCertManager_**, select it by clicking the checkbox.
   - If the policy does not exist, create one.
      - Choose **Create Policy**, then select the **JSON** tab to open the policy editor.
      - Replace the existing template with a trust policy document.

      ```json
      {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
      {
      "Sid": "IoTWirelessGatewayCertManager",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
      "iot:CreateKeysAndCertificate",
      "iot:DescribeCertificate",
      "iot:ListCertificates",
      "iot:RegisterCertificate"
               ],
      "Resource": "*"
                }
            ]
      }
      ```

      - Select **Next Tags** and click **Next: Review** to open the Review Page.
      - For the **Name**, type **_AWSIoTWirelessGatewayCertManager_**.

   :::tip üìù NOTE:
   You must enter the name as **_AWSIoTWirelessGatewayCertManager_** and must not use a different name. This is for consistency with future releases.
   :::

     - For the **Description**, enter a description of your choice.
     - Then choose **Create policy**. You will see a confirmation message showing the policy has been created.

6. Click **Next**.
7. In **Role** name, enter **_IoTWirelessGatewayCertManagerRole_**, and then choose to **Create role**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
You must not use a different name.  This is for consistency with future releases.
:::

8. In the confirmation message, choose **_IoTWirelessGatewayCertManagerRole_** to edit the new role.
9. In the **Summary**, choose the **Trust relationships** tab, and then choose **Edit trust relationship**.
10.  In the **Policy Document**, change the **Principal** property to represent the IoT Wireless service:

```json
"Principal": {
"Service": "iotwireless.amazonaws.com"
},
```

- After changing the Principal property, the complete policy document should look like the following:

```json
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
    {
"Effect": "Allow",
"Principal": {
"Service": "iotwireless.amazonaws.com"
        },
"Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
"Condition": {}
    }
    ]
}
```

11.  Choose **Update Trust Policy** to save your changes and exit.
At this point, you have created the **_IoTWirelessGatewayCertManagerRole_** and you won't need to do this again.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The examples in this document are intended only for dev environments. All devices in your fleet must have credentials with privileges that authorize only intended actions on specific resources. The specific permission policies can vary for your use case. Identify the permission policies that best meet your business and security requirements.

"Effect": "Allow",
"Principal": {
"Service": "iotwireless.amazonaws.com"
},
"Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
"Condition": {}
   }
   ]
}
```
5. Choose **Update Trust Policy.**

### Add the Gateway to AWS IoT

<b> Requirements </b>

To complete setting up your gateway, you need the following:

- LoRaWAN region. For example, if the gateway is deployed in a US region, the gateway must support LoRaWAN region US915.
- Gateway LNS-protocols. Currently, the LoRa Basics Station protocol is supported.
- Gateway ID (GatewayEUI) or serial number. This is used to establish the connection between the LNS and the gateway. Consult the documentation for your gateway to locate this value.
- Add minimum software versions required, including Basics Station 2.0.5.

#### Add the LoRaWAN Gateway

To register the gateway with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN, execute these steps:

1. Go to the [AWS IoT console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/iot).
2. Select **Wireless connectivity** in the navigation panel on the left.
3. Choose **Gateways**, and then click **Add Gateway**.
4. In the **Add gateway section**, fill in the **GatewayEUI** and **Frequency band (RF Region)** fields.
5. Enter a descriptive name in the **Name** ‚Äì optional field. It is recommended that you use the GatewayEUI as the name.
6. Choose **Add gateway**.
7. On the **Configure your Gateway** page, find the section titled **Gateway certificate**.
8. Select **Create certificate**.
9. Once the **Certificate created and associated with your gateway** message is shown, select **Download certificates** to download the certificate (*xxxxx.cert.pem*) and private key (*xxxxxx.private.key*).
10. In the section **Provisioning credentials**, choose **Download server trust certificates** to download the **CUPS (cups.trust)** and **LNS (lns.trust)** server trust certificates.
11. Copy the CUPS and LNS endpoints and save them in a `.txt` file for use while configuring the gateway.
12. Choose **Submit** to add the gateway.

### Add a LoRaWAN Device to AWS IoT

<b> Requirements: </b>

- Locate and note the following specifications about your endpoint device.
    - **LoRaWAN Region** - This must match the gateway LoRaWAN region. The following Frequency bands (RF regions) are supported:
        o	EU868
        o	US915
        o	EU433
    - **MAC Version** - This must be one of the following:
        o	V1.0.2
        o	v1.0.3
        o	v1.1
    - OTAA v1.0x and OTAA v1.1 are supported.
    - ABP v1.0x and ABP v1.1 are supported.

- Locate and note the following information from your device manufacturer:
    - For OTAA v1.0x devices: DevEUI, AppKey, AppEUI
    - For OTAA v1.1 devices: DevEUI, AppKey, NwkKey, JoinEUI
    - For ABP v1.0x devices: DevEUI, DevAddr, NwkSkey, AppSkey
    - For ABP v1.1 devices: DevEUI, DevAddr, NwkSEnckey, FNwkSIntKey, SNwkSIntKey, AppSKey

#### Verify Profiles

AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN supports device profiles and service profiles. Device profiles contain the communication and protocol parameter values the device needs to communicate with the network server.  Service profiles describe the communication parameters the device needs to communicate with the application server.

Some pre-defined profiles are available for device and service profiles.  Before proceeding, verify that these profile settings match the devices you will be setting up to work with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN.

1. Navigate to the [AWS IoT console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/iot). In the navigation pane, choose **Wireless connectivity** then click **Profiles**.
2. In the **Device Profiles** section, there are some pre-defined profiles listed.
3. Check each of the profiles to determine if one of them will work for you. If not, select **Add device profile** and set up the parameters as needed. For US 915 as an example, the values are:
      - MacVersion 1.0.3
      - RegParamsRevision RP002-1.0.1
      - MaxEirp 10
      - MaxDutyCycle 10
      - RfRegion US915
      - SupportsJoin true

4. Click **Add device profile** once you have set a device profile that will work for you.
5. In the **Service Profiles** section, click **Add service profile** and set up the parameters as needed. As an example, the default service profile parameters are shown below. However, only the **_AddGwMetadata_** setting can be changed at this time.
      - UlRate 60
      - UlBucketSize 4096
      - DlRate 60
      - DlBucketSize 4096
      - AddGwMetadata true
      - DevStatusReqFreq 24
      - DrMax 15
      - TargetPer 5
      - MinGwDiversity 1

7. Proceed only if you have a device and service profile that will work for you.

#### Set up a Destination for Device Traffic

Because most LoRaWAN devices don't send data to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN in a format that can be consumed by AWS services, traffic must first be sent to a Destination. A Destination represents the AWS IoT rule that processes a device's data for use by AWS services. This AWS IoT rule contains the SQL statement that selects the device's data and the topic rule actions that send the result of the SQL statement to the services that will use it.

For more information on Destinations, refer to the AWS [LoRaWAN Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan.html).

A destination consists of a Rule and a Role. To set up the destination, execute the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [AWS IoT console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/iot). In the navigation pane, choose **Wireless connectivity**, and then **Destinations**.
2. Choose **Add Destination**.
3. For the **Destination name**, enter **_ProcessLoRa_**, and then add an appropriate description under **Destination description ‚Äì optional**.
4. For **Rule name**, enter **_LoRaWANRouting_**. Ignore the section **Rules configuration ‚Äì Optional** for now.  The Rule will be set up later in the "Hello World" sample application. See Create the IoT Rule for the destination.
5. In the **Permissions** section, choose **Select an existing service role** and select the IAM role you had created earlier, from the drop-down.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The Destination name can be anything. For getting started and consistency, choose **ProcessLoRa** for the first integration with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN.
:::

5. Choose **Add Destination**.  You will see a message "_Destination added_", indicating the destination has been successfully added.

#### Register the Device

Now, register an endpoint device with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN as follows:

1. Go to the [AWS IoT console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/iot).
2. Select **Wireless connectivity** in the navigation panel on the left.
3. Select **Devices**, then choose **Add wireless device**.
4. On the **Add device** page, select the LoRaWAN specification version in the drop-down under **Wireless device specification**.
5. Under **LoRaWAN specification and wireless device configuration**, enter the **DevEUI** and confirm it in the **Confirm DevEUI** field.
6. Enter the remaining fields as per the OTAA/ABP choice you made above.
7. Enter a name for your device in the **Wireless device name ‚Äì optional field**.
8. In the **Profiles** section, under **Wireless device profile**, from the drop-down option find the device profile you have created or the one that corresponds to your device and region.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Compare your device details to ensure the device profile is correct.  If there are no valid default options, you will have to create a new profile. See the [Verify Profiles](#verify-profiles) section.
:::

9. Click **Next** and then choose the destination you created earlier (_ProcessLoRa_) from the drop-down under **Choose destination**.
10. Choose **Add device**. You will see a message saying "_Wireless device added_", indicating that your device has been set up successfully.

      "PayloadData": "AWf/1w==",
      "WirelessMetadata": {
      "LoRaWAN": {
      "DataRate": "4",
      "DevEui": "0000000000000088",
      "FPort": 1,
      "Frequency": "868100000",
      "Gateways": [
              {
      "GatewayEui": "80029cffXXXXXXXX",
      "Rssi": -109,
      "Snr": 5
              }
          ],
      "Timestamp": "2021-02-08T04:00:40Z"
          }
      }
      }
  ```

11.	Choose **Save** to save the event.
12. In a new window, navigate to the AWS IoT console, choose **Test** on the navigation pane, and select MQTT test client.
13.	In Subscription topic field type ‚Äú#‚Äù (all topics) and click Subscribe to topic. The MQTT will subscribe to all topics.
14.	Click on Test in the Lambda function page to generate the test event you just created.
15.	Verify the published data in the AWS IoT Core MQTT Test client. The output should look similar to this:


```json
    000000000000000088/project/sensor/decoded      February 09, 2021, 14:45:29 (UTC+0800)
    {
        "devEui": "000000000000000088",
        "fPort": 1,
        "freq": "868100000",
        "timestamp": "2021-02-08T04:00:40Z",
        "temperature": -4.1
    }
```

#### Create the Destination Rule

In this section, create the IoT rule that forwards the device payload to your application.  This rule is associated with the destination created earlier in Set up a Destination for Device Traffic section.

1. Navigate to the [AWS IoT console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/iot).
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Act**, then select **Rules**.
3. On the Rules page, choose **Create**.

    :::tip üìù NOTE:
    The **Name of your Rule** is the information needed when you provision devices to run on AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN.
    :::

5. Leave the default Rule query statement: '**SELECT * FROM 'iot/topic**' unchanged. This query has no effect at this time, as traffic is currently forwarded to the rules engine based on the destination.
6. Under Set one or more actions, choose **Add action**.
7. On the Select an action page, choose **Republish a message to an AWS IoT topic**. Scroll down and choose **Configure action**.
8. On the Configure action page, for Topic, enter **_project/sensor/decoded_**. The AWS IoT Rules Engine will forward messages to this topic.
9. Under **Choose or create a role to grant AWS IoT access to perform this action**, select **Create Role**.
10. For Name, enter a name of your choice.
11. Choose **Create role** to complete the role creation. You will see a "**Policy Attached**" tag next to the role name, indicating that the Rules Engine has been permitted to execute the action.
12. Choose **Add action**.
13. Add one more action to invoke the Lambda function. Under **Set one or more actions**, choose **Add action**.
14. Choose **Send a message to a Lambda function**.

## ChirpStack

This guide will show you how to connect the RAKWireless Commercial V2 gateway running WisGateOS 2 to a ChirpStack Network server, whether it is installed in the local or external network.

The guide is not about how to install the ChirpStack, but how to configure the gateway to send data to it.

### Configuring the Edge Gateway V2 to ChirpStack

As mentioned before, the guide is for all RAK Edge V2 Series gateways running WisGateOS 2. It will be separated into two main sections based on where the ChirpStack Network server is installed:

- Local ChirpStack
- External ChirpStack

Different methods on how to connect the gateway to the server will be shown.

#### Local ChirpStack

In this case, the ChirpStack is installed in the local network. Three options will be considered here:

- **Connecting the Gateway via Packet Forwarder**
- **Connecting the Gateway via MQTT Bridge**
- **Connecting the Gateway via Basics Station**

Each option is explained in a separate section.

##### Connecting the Gateway via Packet Forwarder

In this method, you will configure the gateway‚Äôs packet forwarder to send data to the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge.

1. Start by accessing the gateway. To see how to access the gateway, refer to the [**Access the Gateway**](/Product-Categories/wisgate/rak7289-v2/Quickstart/#access-the-gateway) section.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7289-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/1.login-page.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Login page"
/>


2. Login using the set credentials you have set in the [**Access the Gateway**](/Product-Categories/wisgate/rak7289-v2/Quickstart/#access-the-gateway) section.

3. On the left side, head to **LoRa**. By default, the gateway is configured to work as a Built-in network server.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7289-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/2.network-server.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Network server settings"
/>


4. From **Work Mode**, select **Packet forwarder**. Click **Choose from the available protocols** to expand the Packet forwarder settings.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7289-v2/supported-lora-network-servers/chirpstack/3.packet-forwarder.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Setting Packet Forwarder Mode"
/>


4. By default, when Packet Forwarder mode is chosen, the **Semtech UDP GWMP Protocol** is selected.

5. To point the gateway to the ChirpStack network using the packet forwarder, you only need to set the **Server address** of the ChirpStack.

In this case, the ChirpStack is installed locally on an Ubuntu machine on IP `192.168.0.130` (yours will be different). The other fields are filled with default parameters and can be left by default.

  width="70%"
  caption="Configuring Packet Forwarder to ChirpStack"
/>


6. Click **Save changes** to save the changes.

Now you need to register the gateway in ChirpStack. The steps are the same for all options.

#### Registering the Gateway in ChirpStack Network Server

1. To register the gateway in the ChirpStack Network server, access the ChirpStack UI. To do that, open a web browser and type the server address of the ChirpStack with port 8080.

```
<IP address of ChirpStack>:8080
```

In this case, the ChirpStack is installed on a local Ubuntu machine with IP `192.168.0.130`. The server address will be `192.168.0.130:8080`.

Here you need to point the gateway to the ChirpStack Network server:

- **Server** ‚Äì For server, choose LNS Server.
- **URI** ‚Äì the address of the ChirpStack server. In this case, the ChirpStack is installed locally on an Ubuntu machine on IP 192.168.0.130 (yours will be different). The URI will be `ws://192.168.0.130`.

::: tip üìù NOTE
The URL starts with ws:// in case a plain text connection is used. Using the wss:// scheme will trigger a TLS connection based on the `tc.{cert,key,trust}` credentials set.
:::

- **Port** ‚Äì the port to which the Websocket listens. The port is 3001.
- **Authentication Mode** ‚Äì authentication for the ChirpStack server. For this case, you will use no authentication.

/>



9. Save and exit the `.toml` file and restart the gateway bridge service to apply the changes by restarting the gateway bridge service with the following command:

```
sudo systemctl restart chirpstack-gateway-bridge.service
```

Now the ChirpStack backend configuration is set to basics station.

10. Then, you need to register the gateway in the ChirpStack Network server. To register the gateway in ChirpStack, see **Registering gateway in ChirpStack Network server** section.

If everything is set correctly, the **Last seen** status will state a few seconds ago. You can click the gateway name to inspect the gateway traffic.

Now your gateway is connected to the ChirpStack Network server.

#### External ChirpStack

In this case, the ChirpStack is installed on an external network. In the following example, the ChirpStack Network server is installed on the AWS cloud. A guide on how to install it on AWS can be found in the [Knowledge Hub](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/Amazon-Web-Services/#installing-chirpstack) section.

To access the ChirpStack web UI, you need to enable **TCP port 8080** and to make the gateway to communicate with the Network server you need to enable the following ports in the inbound rules of the instance:

- The Semtech Packet Forwarder needs UDP port 1700.
- MQTT Bridge (unsecured) needs TCP port 1883.
- MQTT Bridge (secured) needs TCP port 8883.
- Basics Station needs TCP port 3001.

:::tip üìù NOTE
A guide on how to open the above ports can be found in the [guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/Amazon-Web-Services/#installing-chirpstack) on how to install ChirpStack on AWS.
:::

Three options will be considered here:

- **Connecting the Gateway via Packet Forwarder**
- **Connecting the Gateway via MQTT Bridge**
- **Connecting the Gateway via Basics Station**

Each option is explained in its own separate section.

##### Connecting the Gateway via Packet Forwarder

In this method, you will configure the gateway‚Äôs packet forwarder to send data to the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge.

Now your gateway is configured to work as Basics Station and it is pointed to the ChirpStack gateway bridge. The default installation of the ChirpStack setups backend of the ChirpStack gateway bridge as `semtech_udp`.

To configure the backend of the ChirpStack gateway bridge, you need to access the configuration file of the bridge. To access it, you will need an SSH terminal. In this case, you will use the PuTTy client.

To access the ChirpStack configuration files, you need to access the instance. How to do this is explained in the [Knowledge Hub](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/Amazon-Web-Services/#accessing-instance-via-ssh) section.

6. In the ChirpStack Gateway bridge webpage, copy the configuration file text and place it in `/etc/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/chirpstack-gateway-bridge.toml`.

7. In the file, find the gateway backend configuration paragraph and replace the type with `basic_station`.

8. Now scroll down until you find the **Concentrator configuration** paragraph and uncomment the following text as shown below.

/>


9. Save and exit the `.toml` file and restart the gateway bridge service to apply the changes by restarting the gateway bridge service with the following command:

```
sudo systemctl restart chirpstack-gateway-bridge.service
```

Now the ChirpStack backend configuration is set to Basics station.

If everything is set correctly, the Last seen status will state a few seconds ago. You can click the gateway name to inspect the gateway traffic.
