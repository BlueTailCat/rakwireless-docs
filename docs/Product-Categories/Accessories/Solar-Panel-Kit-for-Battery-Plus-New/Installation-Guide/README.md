## Solar Panel Orientation

The placement and orientation of solar panels are as important as the type of solar panel used in a given situation. A solar panel will harness most energy when the sun's rays strike its surface perpendicularly. Proper orientation and tilt of the panels help ensure that they generate maximum energy by exposing them to the highest intensity of sunlight for the longest possible period of time.

<b> Direction </b>

In the Northern Hemisphere, the general rule is that solar panels should face south (and north in the south). This is usually the best orientation because the solar panels receive direct light throughout the day. However, it's important to take into account the difference between magnetic south and true south.

Magnetic south is the direction indicated as "south" by a compass. This direction points towards the Earth's magnetic South Pole. However, when it comes to positioning the solar modules, they must be oriented towards the solar or geographic south, which is the direction of the South Pole.
If the solar module is located in the Southern Hemisphere, it should be oriented toward the true north.

<b> Angle </b>

The angle of a solar panel to produce maximum energy production is determined by latitude. A general rule for optimal annual energy production is that the tilt angle of the solar module should correspond to the geographic latitude.

For example, if the location of the solar module is at a latitude of 50¬∞, then the ideal tilt angle should also be 50¬∞. Basically, the closer a solar module is to the equator, the more it should point straight up. On the other hand, the closer the modules are to the poles, the more they should be tilted toward the equator.


## Installation Guide

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The pole's diameter supported by the brackets is 50-100&nbsp;mm. If the pole diameter is less than this value, you can add some rubber pads to it. RAK do not offer brackets for wider poles.
:::

1. Fix bracket-1 on the back of the solar panel with screw set-1, as shown in **Figure 2**.
2. Fix bracket-2 (half) onto bracket-1 with screw set-2, as shown in **Figure 2**.

3. Fix bracket-2 on the pole by connecting the two halves using screw set-3.
