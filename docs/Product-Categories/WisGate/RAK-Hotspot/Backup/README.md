# SD Card Backup

## Prerequisites
RAK
### What Do You Need?

1. [**RAK Hotspot**](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak-hotspot-miner?utm_source=RAKHotspotMiner&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
2. USB microSD Card Reader
3. 32GB or larger microSD Card (optional, to store the backup). To maintain similar performance we recommend a UHS-I compliant microSD card, for example, Sandisk&trade; High Endurance or Extreme.


### Power Down the RAK Hotspot

:::warning ⚠️ WARNING
Take care in removing the microSD card from the Hotspot. It is fragile; hence, using small pliers is highly recommended.
:::

1. Disconnect the RAK Hotspot from the power supply. It needs to be off.
2. Extract the microSD card from the Hotspot slot.
3. Insert the microSD into the USB microSD card reader.


## SD Clone for macOS

1. Start by downloading [SD Clone](https://twocanoes.com/products/mac/sd-clone/).

### Image Backup

1. First, select the drive letter corresponding to the drive where your card is. This is where the image will be copied from.

2. Next, you need to provide a path to the file the data is going to be backed in. You can do this either by entering it manually in the text box or clicking the folder icon.
