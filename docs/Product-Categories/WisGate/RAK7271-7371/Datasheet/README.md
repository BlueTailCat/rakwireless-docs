# RAK7271/RAK7371 WisGate Developer Base Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK Developer Base is a device designed for integration with desktop/mobile/embedded systems that converts the RAK2287/RAK5146 mPCIe LoRa concentrator modules into USB Type C pluggable (via the include Type C to A cable).

This new approach allows for it to be easily integrated into existing hardware like routers, industrial PC, etc., adding LoRaWAN gateway capabilities (for example turning a laptop into a testbed LoRaWAN gateway by simply plugging it in and running the software stack)

As it features fully functioning concentrators modules it is capable of working with 8 uplink and 1 downlink channels at SF7-12 (RAK2287) / SF5-12 (RAK5146).

The RAK Developer Base is an ideal solution for LPWAN deployments where integration with existing hardware is crucial, or scenarios when on the go deployment is required, for drive testing or coverage evaluation in mobile scenarios.

This device is a complete and cost-efficient LoRa gateway solution offering up to 10 programmable parallel demodulation paths.

### Features

- Compatible with RAK2287(SX1302) / RAK5146(SX1303) concentrator modules with 8 uplink channels and 1 downlink channel.
- 2 x SX125x Tx/Rx front-ends.
- Tx power up to 27 dBm, Rx sensitivity down to -139 dBm @ SF12, BW 125 kHz.
- Supports global license-free frequency band (EU433, CN470, IN865, EU868, US915, AU915, KR920, AS923)
- USB Type C interface port (USB 2.0)

#### Interfaces

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7271-7371/datasheet/3.interfaces.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="WisGate Developer Base Interfaces"
/>

- **Power supply**: There is a 5&nbsp;V to 3.3&nbsp;V DC-DC converter integrated on RAK2005, so the 5&nbsp;V DC that comes from the USB interface is enough for this device.
- **USB Interface**: This device can be connected to any USB 2.0 host equipped with compatible drivers. The RAK2287/RAK5146 module inside can support high-speed USB to SPI by STM32L412KBU6. It includes a USB 2.0 compliant interface with a maximum 480&nbsp;Mb/s data rate, representing the interface for any communication with an external host application processor.
- **RP-SMA antenna interface**: The modules have one RF interface over a standard RPSMA connector with a characteristic impedance of 50&nbsp;Œ©. The RF port supports both Tx and Rx, providing the antenna interface.
