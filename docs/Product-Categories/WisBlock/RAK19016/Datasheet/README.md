### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into six parts. It discusses the interfacing, pinouts, and their corresponding functions and diagrams of the module. It also covers the electrical, mechanical, and environmental characteristics that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK19016 WisBlock 5~24&nbsp;V Power Slot Module.

#### Interfaces

RAK19016 WisBlock 5~24&nbsp;V Power Slot Module provides the following interfaces:

* Three-pin Screw Terminal Connector
* Battery Connector
* LEDs: one for charging status and two for user
* Reset button

::: tip üìù NOTE
RAK19016 doesn't have a USB connector. When RAK19016 is used together with WisBlock Base board with power slot, it is not possible to program the core (unless via SWD pins using external tools like Jlink and RAKDAP1). If you want to program the WisBlock Core, you can use <a href="https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak5804-wisblock-interface-extension-board" target="_blank">RAK5804</a> and its USB connector.

::: tip üìù NOTE
The voltage of the battery must not exceed 4.3&nbsp;V.
:::

##### LEDs

Three LEDs are used to indicate the operating status. Below are the functions of the LEDs:

- üî¥ **Red LED**: Connected to the charger chip to indicate the charger status. When the battery is charging, this red LED is on. When the battery is full, this LED is weak light or off.
- üü¢ **Green LED**: Connected to the MCU module, controlled by MCU defined by the user.
- üîµ **Blue LED**: Connected to the MCU module, controlled by MCU defined by the user.

##### RESET Push Button

The Reset Push Button shown in [**Figure 3**](#interfaces) is connected to the MCU module. When pushed, it resets the MCU.

#### Pin Definition

The RAK19016 module has a 40-pin WisConnector that is compatible with the WisBlock Power Slot. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 5**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
VBAT, 3V3, RESET, LED1, LED2, ADC_VBAT, and GND have connected to WisBlock 40-pin connector.
