### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into five parts. It shows the chipset of the module and discusses the pinouts and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical and mechanical parameters that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard ratings of the RAK13101 WisBlock GSM/GPRS Module.

#### Chipset

| Vendor  | Part number |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Quectel | MC20CE      |

#### Pin Definition

The RAK13101 WisBlock GSM/GPRS module comprises a standard WisBlock IO slot connector. The WisBlock connector allows the RAK13101 module to be mounted on a WisBlock baseboard with IO slot, such as RAK5005-O. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 2**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
- RAK13101 WisBlock IO slot connector utilizes the **UART** related pins, **PWRKEY** via WB_IO5, **VBAT**, **3V3**, and **GND**.

- **VBAT** is the battery voltage input with max voltage 4.2&nbsp;V. During GPRS data and GSM dial mode, the peak current is 1170&nbsp;mA and 769&nbsp;mA, respectively, which exceeds the USB port supply current. That is why you must use a dedicated battery.

#### Schematic Diagram

##### Power Supply

The Quectel MC20CE module's main power supply comes from **VBAT**, which is a battery voltage connected to the WisBlock Base board. **GNSS_VCC** is the GNSS section supply voltage and is turned on or off via **GNSS_VCC_EN**, which is connected to MC20CE. The power supply of the GNSS part is controlled via the AT command `AT+QGNSSC`.

##### Voltage Level Transfer

The GSM/GPRS module operates at 2.8&nbsp;V, while the WisBlock Core is at 3.3&nbsp;V. That is why a voltage level shifter is needed.
