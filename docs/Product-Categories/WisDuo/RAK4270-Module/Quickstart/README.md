## Product Configuration

### Interfacing with RAK4270

During the configuration of the module through the AT commands, it is possible to read the console outputs. You can connect to the console of the RAK4270 Module through the UART interface.

#### Connect to the RAK4270

In this document, a RAK4270 Module is used as an example case. Use a USB to TTL converter to connect to the module.

1. Connect the RAK4270 to a serial port of a general-purpose computer (e.g.: USB port) using a USB to TTL module (3.3v), as shown in **Figure 1**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/1.module-connection.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="RAK4270 Module Connection"
/>

2. Any serial communication tool can be used. But, it is recommended to use the [RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools/RAK_SERIAL_PORT_TOOL_V1.2.1.zip).

3. Configure the serial communication tool by selecting the proper port detected by the computer and configure the link as follows:

 * Baud Rate: **115200 bauds**
 * Data Bits: **8 bits**
 * Stop Bits: **1 stop bit**
 * Parity: **NONE**

4. The RAK4270 console output can now be read in the RAK serial port tool, as shown in **Figure 2**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/2.serial-port-tool-connected.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="RAK Serial Port Tool Connected to RAK4270 Module"
/>

### Configuring RAK4270

To connect the RAK4270 Module to a LoRa P2P connection or a LoRaWAN network, the module must be configured and LoRa parameters must be set by sending AT commands. You can send AT commands to the RAK4270 Module through the UART interface.

Connect the RAK4270 Module to the computer as described in the previous section. Use the serial communication tool to send commands to the RAK4270. For example, sending the `at+version` will return and display the current firmware version, as shown in **Figure 3**. More AT commands can be found in the [AT Command Manual](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4270-Module/AT-Command-Manual/#rak4270-at-command-manual).

### Connecting to The Things Stack (TTN V3)

This section will show how to connect the RAK4270 Module to The Things Stack (TTN V3) platform.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/4.ttn-context.png"
  width="95%"
  caption="The Things Stack diagram"
/>

As shown in **Figure 4**, The Things Stack is an open-source LoRaWAN Network Server suitable for global, geo-distributed public and private deployments as well as for small, local networks. The architecture follows the LoRaWAN Network Reference Model for standards compliancy and interoperability. This project is actively maintained by [The Things Industries](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/).

LoRaWAN is a protocol for low-power wide-area networks. It allows for large-scale Internet of Things deployments where low-powered devices efficiently communicate with Internet-connected applications over long-range wireless connections.

The RAK4270 Module can be part of this ecosystem as a device, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple it is to send data to The Things Stack using the LoRaWAN protocol. To achieve this, the RAK4270 Module must be located inside the coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway connected to The Things Stack server.


#### Registration to TTN and Creating LoRaWAN Applications

The first step is to go to [The Things Network platform](https://console.cloud.thethings.network/) and select a cluster, as shown in **Figure 5**. The Things Industries adds more clusters from time to time so select the one closes to your location. In this guide, Europe 1 is selected.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/t_image_1.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Selecting Cluster in TTN V3"
/>

You can use the same login credentials on the TTN V2 if you have one. If you have no account yet, you need to create one.

1. To register as a new user to TTN, click on **Login with The Things ID** then select **register** on the next page, as shown in **Figure 6** and **Figure 7**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/t_image_2.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Login using TTN account"
/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/t_image_3.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Registration of new account"
/>

You should now be on the step of creating your TTN account. Fill in all the necessary details and activate your account.

2. After creating an account, you should log in to the platform using your username/email and password then click **Submit**, as shown in **Figure 8**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/t_image_4.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Logging in to TTN platform"
/>

3. Click **Authorize** to proceed.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/t_image_5.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Authorization to TTN"
/>

4. Now that you are logged in to the platform, the next step is to create an application. Click **Create an application**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/t_image_6.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Creating TTN application for your LoRaWAN devices"
/>

5. To have an application registered, you need to input first the specific details and necessary information about your application then click **Create application**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/t_image_7.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Details of the TTN application"
/>

If you have no error on the previous step, you should now be on the application console page. The next step is to add end-devices to your The Things Stack application. LoRaWAN specification enforces that each end device has to be personalized and activated. There are two options on registering devices depending on the activation mode selected. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or Activation-By-Personalization (ABP).

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Once you have the application in The Things Stack (TTN V3), you need to ensure that you are in coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway that is registered to The Things Stack (TTN V3) as well. Without the coverage of that LoRaWAN gateway, you cannot activate any device that you will register in your application.

RAKwireless has [LoRaWAN gateways](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisgate) that you can connect to The Things Stack (TTN V3) if no LoRaWAN gateway coverage is available in your location.

:::

#### The Things Stack OTAA Device Registration

1. Go to your application console to be able to register a device. To start adding an OTAA end-device, you need to click **+ Add end device**, as shown in **Figure 12**.

6. Once the node is created, fill in the necessary data. You can generate a Device EUI automatically by clicking the following icon, or you can write a correct Device EUI in the edit box.

Fill in the parameters requested:

* **Device name and Device description**: These are descriptive texts about your device.
* **Device EUI**: This interface allows you to generate a Device EUI automatically by clicking the icon highlighted in red in **Figure 42**. You can also add a specific Device EUI directly in the form.
* **Device Profile**:
  * If you want to join in OTAA mode, select ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_OTAA**‚Äù.
  * If you want to join in ABP mode, select ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_ABP**‚Äù.

#### LoRaWAN Join Mode

In LoRaWAN, there are two (2) ways a node can connect itself to the LoRaWAN network. This is referred to as **Join Mode**. LoRaWAN allows the OTAA mode and the ABP mode. In this section, the configuration process of these two modes, both on the platform side and the node side will be explained.


##### OTAA Mode

###### Configure the OTAA Mode on the Platform

1. If you have selected ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_OTAA**‚Äù, as shown in **Figure 43**, then after the device is created, an Application Key must be also created for this device.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/31.otaa.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA Activation"
/>

2. A previously created Application Key can be entered here, or a new one can be generated automatically by clicking the icon highlighted in red in **Figure 44**:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/32.otaa-set-device-keys.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA Set Device Keys"
/>

3. Once the Application Key is added to the form, the process can be finalized by clicking on the ‚Äú**SET DEVICE-KEYS**‚Äù button.

* As shown in **Figure 45**, a new device should be listed in the DEVICES tab. The most important parameters, such as the Device EUI, are shown in the summary.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/33.list-device.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA List of Device in the Device Tab"
/>

4. To end the process, it is a good practice to review that the Application Key is properly associated with this device. The Application Key can be verified in the **KEYS(OTAA)** tab, as shown in **Figure 46**.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/34.application-key.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Key Associated with the New Device"
/>


:::tip üìù NOTE:

Standard OTAA mode requires the **Device EUI**, **Application Key**, and the **Application EUI**. But in ChirpStack‚Äôs implementation, only the Device EUI and the Application Key are mandatory. The Application EUI is not required and is not recorded in the Application tab. Nevertheless, the Application EUI is a mandatory parameter in the RAK4270 module‚Äôs firmware. To resolve this mismatch, you can reuse the Device EUI as the Application EUI during the configuration on the side of the node.

:::

###### Configure the OTAA Mode on the RAK4270

The RAK4270 Module supports a series of [AT commands](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4270-Module/AT-Command-Manual/#rak4270-at-command-manual) to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module.

To set up the RAK4270 Module to join ChirpStack using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK4270 Module to the computer (see **Figure 1**), open the RAK Serial Port Tool, and then wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending either of these two AT commands:


```
at+get_config=lora:status
```

```
at+version
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/3.command-response.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>

As an example, these are the list of the parameters you need to configure in RAK4270:

- LoRa join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRa class: **Class A**
- LoRa region: **EU868**
- Device EUI: **5e9d1e0857cf25f1**
- Application EUI: **5e9d1e0857cf25f1**
- Application Key: **f921d50cd7d02ee3c5e6142154f274b2**

1. Set the LoRa join mode to OTAA.

```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:0
```

2. Set the LoRa class to Class A.

```
at+set_config=lora:class:0
```

3. Set the frequency/region to EU868.

- Refer to the [RAK4270 Module Datasheet](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4270-Module/Datasheet/#rf-characteristics) for the list of supported frequencies.


```
at+set_config=lora:region:EU868
```

4. Set the Device EUI.

```
at+set_config=lora:dev_eui:5e9d1e0857cf25f1
```

5. Set the Application EUI.

```
at+set_config=lora:app_eui:5e9d1e0857cf25f1
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The Application EUI parameter is not required in the ChirpStack platform. Therefore, it is possible to use the same ID as the Device EUI. Otherwise, the firmware will complain.
:::

6. Set the Application Key.

- Get the Application Key from the TTN register.


```
at+set_config=lora:app_key:f921d50cd7d02ee3c5e6142154f274b2
```

  width="45%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA configuration via RAK Serial Port Tool"
/>


:::tip üìù NOTE:
After configuring all the parameters, you need to reset your RAK4270 Module to save the parameters.
:::

7. After resetting, start to join.

```
at+join
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/37.otaa-join-chirpstack.png"
  width="45%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA Join the Network via RAK Serial Port Tool"
/>

8. You can then see the JoinRequest and JoinAccept on the ChirpStack page.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/38.chirpstack-console.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Checking LoRaWAN Joint Request in Chirpstack OTAA Console"
/>

9. Now, try to send data from the RAK4270 Module to ChirpStack.

```
at+send=lora:2:1234567890
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/39.send-message-chirpstack.png"
  width="45%"
  caption="Send a LoRaWAN Message via RAK Serial Port Tool"
/>



- On the ChirpStack platform, you should also see the messages in the LORAWAN FRAMES tab, as shown in **Figure 52**. By convention, messages sent from nodes to gateways are considered as **Uplinks**, while messages sent by gateways to nodes are considered as **Downlinks**.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/40.message-received.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack Data Received Preview"
/>

This concludes the exercise to send data in the OTAA mode.


##### ABP Mode

###### Configure the ABP Mode on the Platform

During the registration of a new device, if you select ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_ABP**‚Äù, as shown in **Figure 53**, then the ChirpStack platform will assume that this device will join the LoRaWAN network using the ABP mode.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Check ‚Äú**Disable counting frame verification**‚Äù. During the test, when the module is restarted, the frame counting number will be also be restarted from zero. This would cause a synchronization problem with the ChirpStack server treating it as a replay attack. For the testing purpose, it is safe to disable this feature, but remember to activate it in a production environment.

  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/41.configuring-device-abp.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="ChirpStack Console, Configuring a Device"
/>

After selecting the ABP mode, the following parameters appear in the Activation tab:

* Device address
* Network Session Key
* Application Session Key

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/42.abp-activation-parameters.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack ABP Activation Parameters Needed"
/>

* The parameters can be generated as random numbers by the platform or can be set with user values. Once these parameters are filled in properly, the process is completed by clicking on the ‚Äú**ACTIVATE DEVICE**‚Äù button.

###### Configure the ABP mode on the RAK4270

In the following steps, you will configure the RAK4270 Module to work in the ABP mode. To set up the RAK4270 Module to join ChirpStack using ABP, start by connecting the RAK4270 Module to the computer (see **Figure 1**), open the RAK Serial Port Tool, and then wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending either of these two AT commands:

```
at+get_config=lora:status
```

```
at+version
```


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/3.command-response.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>

As an example, these are the list of the parameters you need to configure in RAK4270:

- LoRa join mode: **ABP**
- LoRa class: **Class A**
- LoRa region: **EU868**
- Device address: **26011af9**
- Network Session Key: **c280cb8d1df688bc18601a97025c5488**
- Application Session Key: **4d42ec5caf97f03d833cdaf5003f69e1**

1. Set LoRa join mode to ABP.

```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:1
```

2. Set LoRa class to Class A.

```
at+set_config=lora:class:0
```

3. Set the frequency/region to EU868.

- Refer to the [RAK4270 Module Datasheet](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4270-Module/Datasheet/#rf-characteristics) for the list of supported frequencies.

```
at+set_config=lora:region:EU868
```

4. Set the Device Address.

```
at+set_config=lora:dev_addr:26011af9
```

5. Set the Network Session Key.

```
at+set_config=lora:nwks_key:c280cb8d1df688bc18601a97025c5488
```

6. Set the Application Session Key.

```
at+set_config=lora:apps_key:4d42ec5caf97f03d833cdaf5003f69e1
```

  width="45%"
  caption="Chirpstack ABP Parameters Configuration via RAK Serial Port Tool"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:

After configuring all the parameters, you need to reset your RAK4270 Module to save the parameters.

:::

7. After resetting the RAK4270 Module, join in ABP mode.

```
at+join
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

By using the ABP mode in the LoRaWAN protocol, it doesn‚Äôt require to join a network before sending the LoRaWAN package. But to keep the consistency of internal states of the firmware of the RAK4270 Module, it is still required to send the `at+join` command in the ABP mode. This time, the firmware should reply almost immediately with an ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.

:::

8. Now, try sending data from the RAK4270 Module to ChirpStack.

```
at+send=lora:2:1234567890
```

<rk-img

### LoRa P2P Mode

This section will show you how to set up and connect two RAK4270 units to work in the LoRa P2P mode. You will be using EU868 as your frequency, although it is applicable also to other standard bands.

1. Two RAK4270 units shall be set to operate on EU868 frequency.

2. The setup of the RAK4270 units is done by connecting them with a general-purpose computer through the UART port. The setup of each RAK4270 can be done separately but testing the LoRa P2P mode will require having both units connected simultaneously to their respective UART port. This could be one computer with two (2) USB ports or two (2) computers with one USB port each.

3. Set the RAK4270 to work in LoRa P2P mode. Open the RAK Serial Port Tool and send the following command:

```
at+set_config=lora:work_mode:1
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4270-module/quickstart/46.lora-p2p.png"
  width="45%"
  caption="P2P Initialization"
/>

4. Then, configure LoRa P2P parameters for both of them.


```
at+set_config=lorap2p:XXX:Y:Z:A:B:C
```

For this example, the LoRa parameters are the following:

- Link frequency: **869525000&nbsp;Hz**
- Spreading factor: **7**
- Bandwidth: **125&nbsp;kHz**
- Coding Rate: **4/5**
- Preamble Length: **5**
- Power: **5&nbsp;dBm**

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Refer to the [Configuring Using AT Commands section](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4270-Module/AT-Command-Manual/#rak4270-at-command-manual) to learn more about the definition of the parameters used.

:::

Hence, it is translated into the following RAK4270 AT command and sent to both units.

```
at+set_config=lorap2p:869525000:7:0:1:5:5
```

  width="45%"
  caption="Configuring P2P in both RAK4270 Module"
/>

5. Set the transmission mode of the module. Unit 1 is configured as the sender, and Unit 2 is set to the receiver by AT command.

```
at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:2

at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:1
```
