## WisBlock Integration

### WisBlock Integration to Ubidots over MQTT

1. Setup the hardware components. The RGB LED strip was used as the load for our relay.

</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/wisblock-integration-to-ubidots-mqtt-google-assistant/led-strip-boards.png" width="80%">
</p>

2. Install the [RAKWireless ESP32 BSP](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK11200/Quickstart/#install-rakwireless-esp32-bsp-on-arduino-boards-manager) on Arduino Boards Manager.

3. Download and install the following libraries into your Arduino IDE:
   - PubSubClient
   - Ubidots ESP MQTT
   - Adafruit_BME680

4.  Before uploading codes to the RAK11200, short circuit **BOOT0** and **GND** pin and press the reset button. Make sure to do this so that your upload will not fail.

5. See [Uploading to WisBlock](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK11200/Quickstart/#uploading-to-wisblock) for a complete guide on Arduino Tools Configuration.

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/wisblock-integration-to-ubidots-mqtt-google-assistant/short-ckt.png" width="60%">
</p>

6. Copy and upload the code from our [WisBlock GitHub repo](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/tutorials/RAK11200_Ubidots_pubsub) into your Arduino IDE.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
- Input your WiFi credentials:

```c
const char *WIFI_SSID = "******";
const char *WIFI_PASS = "******";

```

- Input your Ubidots Default Token:
Refer to this guide [to find your Ubidots Default Token](https://help.ubidots.com/en/articles/590078-find-your-token-from-your-ubidots-account).

```c
const char *UBIDOTS_TOKEN = "******";
```
:::

7. Once you're done uploading the code, go and log in to your Ubidots account. It will automatically input the newly created device, its variables within the device, and sensor data.

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/wisblock-integration-to-ubidots-mqtt-google-assistant/board-info.png" width="100%">
</p>

8. The relay variable has not been automatically inserted in Ubidots, and it is still missing. We need to manually add a variable for the relay:

   - Select the **Add Variable**.
   - Choose **Raw**.
   - Rename the added variable with **relay**.

9. Then, you can create your own dashboard where you can monitor the environment coming from the sensor. To create a dashboard, go to [Create Dashboards and Widgets](https://help.ubidots.com/en/articles/2400308-create-dashboards-and-widgets).

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/wisblock-integration-to-ubidots-mqtt-google-assistant/dashboard.png" width="100%">
</p>

10. Set up an IFTTT to control your relay where the RGB LED strip is connected to your system via voice command using Google Assistant.

### WisBlock Integration to Google Assistant over IFTTT

1. After integrating your WisBlock with Ubidots, log in to your IFTTT account.
2. Select **Create** to create a new Applet.
3. Then click the **If This Add** icon.

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/wisblock-integration-to-ubidots-mqtt-google-assistant/applets.png" width="60%">
</p>

4. Search and select **Google Assistant**.

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/wisblock-integration-to-ubidots-mqtt-google-assistant/google-assistant.png" width="60%">
</p>

5. Select the **Say a simple phrase**.

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/wisblock-integration-to-ubidots-mqtt-google-assistant/phrases.png" width="80%">
</p>

6. You need to fill the fields with the Google Assistant to switch the relay and turn our RGB LED light on.
For example:
- **What do you want to say?**: Turn on the led
- **What's another way to say it? (optional)**: Switch on the led
- **And another way? (optional)**: Lights on
- **What do you want the Assistant to say in response?**: Okay RAKstar! Turning on the led lights
- **Language**: English

Then, click **Create trigger**.

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/wisblock-integration-to-ubidots-mqtt-google-assistant/trigger.png" width="60%">
</p>

7. When the trigger is already set, create the action **Then That Add**.
8. Then, choose Webhooks as action service.

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/wisblock-integration-to-ubidots-mqtt-google-assistant/service.png" width="60%">
</p>

9. Make a web request and fill the fields of the WebHooks setup with the following parameters:
- **URL**: `http://industrial.api.ubidots.com/api/v1.6/devices/{DEVICE-LABEL}?token={YOUR-UBIDOTS-TOKEN}`
- **Method**: POST
- **Content Type**: application/json
- **Body**: {"relay":1}

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/wisblock-integration-to-ubidots-mqtt-google-assistant/action.png" width="40%">
</p>

Then, click **Create action** to finish.

10.  Once the trigger and action have been properly configured and connected, go to your Google Assistant and say **Turn on the led** and listen to Google Assistant's response. See how the relay is turned on to switch the RGB LED strip.

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/wisblock-integration-to-ubidots-mqtt-google-assistant/connect.png" width="50%">
</p>

11. Repeat the previous steps to create the applet that will switch the relay and turn off the RGB LED strip. All of the preceding steps are the same; the only differences are listed below:

- **Trigger Configuration (Google Assistant)**: switch `on` for `off`
- **Action Configuration (Webhooks)**: the body should be `{"relay":0}` to switch off the relay

12. Once both applets are created and connected, you‚Äôre done! You can now control and automate your devices using Google voice commands.

Now, you have a smart home application for remotely controlling your devices by using Ubidots and Google Assistant!
