# RAK19015 WisBlock Battery Power Slot Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The **RAK19015 WisBlock Battery Power Slot Module** is a power board that comprises a battery connector, a reset push button, and two LEDs. It is designed to be used with WisBlock Base Board with Power Slot via the 40-pin WisBlock connector.

RAK19015 is optimized to support very low-power applications since it only has a Li-Ion battery and 3.3&nbsp;V switching regulator in the circuit removing unnecessary components that consume extra current consumption.

### Features

- Designed for battery-only powered applications
- High-efficiency switching regulator
- Optimized for low-power devices
- Module size: 30 x 20&nbsp;mm

### Hardware

The hardware specification discusses the pinouts and their corresponding functions and diagrams of the module. It also covers the electrical and mechanical characteristics that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK19015 WisBlock Battery Power Slot Module.

#### Interfaces

RAK19015 WisBlock Battery Power Slot Module provides the following interfaces, headers, a button, and WisConnectors:

* 1 WisBlock Power module
* 2 pin battery interface
* 2 LEDs
* 1 Reset button

::: tip üìù NOTE
RAK19015 doesn't have a USB connector, so when RAK19015 and RAK19010 are used together, it is not possible to program the core (unless you use Jlink). If you want to program the core, you need the <a href="https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak5804-wisblock-interface-extension-board" target="_blank">RAK5804</a>. Then you can supply over RAK19015 and program over RAK5804.

::: tip üìù NOTE
The voltage of the battery must not exceed 4.3&nbsp;V.
:::

##### LEDs

Two LEDs are used to indicate the operating status. Below are the functions of the LEDs:

- üü¢ **Green LED** - Connected to the MCU module, controlled by MCU defined by the user.
- üîµ **Blue LED** - Connected to the MCU module, controlled by MCU defined by the user.

##### RESET Push Button

The Reset Push Button is shown in [**Figure 3**](#interfaces) and is connected to the MCU module. When pushed, it resets the MCU.

#### Pin Definition

The RAK19015 Battery Power Slot Module has a 40-pin WisConnector that is compatible with the WisBlock Power Slot. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 5**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
VBAT, 3V3, RESET, LED1, LED2, and GND are connected to the WisBlock IO connector.
