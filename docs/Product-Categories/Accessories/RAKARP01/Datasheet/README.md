1. Determine the placement of the antenna, take it and the accessories out of the package, and prepare your tools (a wrench).

2. Install the antenna to a ‚àÖ 30 ~ 75&nbsp;mm mounting pole using the clamps, screw bolts, and saw-tooth clamps as shown in Figure 3.

3. Position the antenna and the pole in parallel, adjust the height, then fully tighten the upper and lower clamps' nuts.

4. Adjust the tilt of the antenna, then tighten the nuts of the screw bolts indicated by ‚òÖ.

5. Connect the feeder cable to the antenna connector and wrap the waterproof tape. After that, the installation finished.


:::tip üìù NOTE:
The positioning and height of the antenna should be pursuant to the installation environment. Make sure that there are no tall buildings or large bodies of metal nearby, there should be no obstructions around it.
