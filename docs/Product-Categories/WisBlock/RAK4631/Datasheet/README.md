# RAK4631 WisBlock LPWAN Module Datasheet


## Overview

### Description

The RAK4631 WisBlock Core module is a RAK4630 stamp module with an expansion PCB and connectors compatible with the RAK5005-O baseboard. It allows an easy way to access to the pins of the RAK4630 module in order to simplify development and testing processes.

The module itself comprises a RAK4630 as its main component. The RAK4630 is a combination of an nRF52840 MCU and an SX1262 LoRa chip, it features ultra-low power consumption of 2.0&nbsp;uA during sleep mode, high LoRa output power up to 22&nbsp;dBm during a transmission mode, and the BLE interface with output power up to 4&nbsp;dBm.

The module complies with LoRaWAN 1.0.2 protocols, it also supports LoRa point-to-point communication.

The RF communication characteristic of the module (LoRa + BLE) makes it suitable for a variety of applications in the IoT field such as home automation, sensor networks, building automation, personal area networks applications (health/fitness sensors, and monitors, etc.).

::: tip üìù NOTE
The RAK4631 and RAK4631-R share common hardware and are 100% identical, but their firmware is different. **RAK4631** firmware is based on the Arduino BSP of the nRF52840 chip, whereas **RAK4631-R** firmware is based on RUI V3, giving you the flexibility to develop optimized firmware using the [RUI3 APIs](/RUI3/Arduino-API/) or via [RUI3 AT commands](/RUI3/Serial-Operating-Modes/AT-Command-Manual/).

You can [convert your RAK4631 to RAK4631-R](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/DFU/#updating-rak4631-to-rui3) if you prefer [RUI3](/RUI3/).

- **WisConnector**: The breakout module allows the RAK4630 stamp module pinout to be transferred by the board-to-board WisConnector.

- **WisConnector Pin Order**: The pin order of the WisConnector is located in the bottom layer of the module.

- **Core Module**: The breakout module itself has a RAK4630 at its core, and it shows the core module pin and connection information. By default, the NFC function is disabled for conserve the low power characteristic.

- **SWD Interface**: The breakout module exposes a SWD debug interface. Additionally, the RST pin is used for resetting the core module RAK4630.

- **Power Up Automatic Reset**: The breakout module has a power-up automatic reset circuit, and the schematic shows the automatic reset mechanism. This module also can be reset though RAK5005-O reset pin.

##### Setup of the SX1262

Information to write custom firmware for the RAK4630.  This shows the internal connection between the RAK4630 and required information when initializing the SX1262 LoRa Transceiver.

| nRF52840 GPIO	| SX1262 pin | function                          |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| P1.10         | NSS        | SPI NSS                           |
| P1.11         | SCK        | SPI CLK                           |
| P1.12         | MOSI       | SPI MOSI                          |
| P1.13         | MISO       | SPI MISO                          |
| P1.14         | BUSY       | BUSY signal                       |
| P1.15         | DIO1       | DIO1 event interrupt              |
| P1.06         | NRESET     | NRESET manual reset of the SX1262 |

Important for successful SX1262 initialization:
- Setup DIO2 to control the antenna switch
- Setup DIO3 to control the TCXO power supply
- Setup the SX1262 to use it's DCDC regulator and not the LDO
- RAK4630 schematics show GPIO P1.07 connected to the antenna switch, but it should not be initialized, as DIO2 will do the control of the antenna switch
