## Product Configuration

### Interfacing with RAK4200 Breakout Board

To interface with the RAK4200 Evaluation Board with your Windows Machine, you need to download the [**RAK Serial Port Tool**](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/#LoRa/Tools/).

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Before powering the RAK4200 Breakout Board, make sure you have installed the included LoRa Antenna. Not doing so might damage the board
:::

- Connect your USB to the UART adapter to the pin header on the RAK4200 via a set of 4 DuPont lines. Use **Figure 1** for reference on wiring the device properly.

- Go to Device Manager by pressing Windows + R and typing devmgmt.msc, or search in the Start Menu.

::: tip üìù NOTE
Windows 10 should recognize the board and automatically install drivers, however, if it is missing in the COM & LPT ports list you need to manually install the CH340 Drivers.
:::

- Look for Ports (COM & LPT) and find the name USB-SERIAL CH340. Take note of the COM Port Number as you will need it to connect with the board. You might have another model number but the wording ‚ÄúUSB-SERIAL‚Äù should be present in some form.

  caption="COM Port settings"
/>

- Open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the COM Port number (the one you noted in the previous step) and set the **Baud Rate to 115200**. Click ‚Äú**OPEN**‚Äù, and you should be connected to the board and be able to send commands.

### Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

The Things Network is about enabling low-power devices to be used in long-range gateways that connect to an open-source, decentralized network and exchange data with Applications. Learn more about [**The Things Network**](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/).

In this section, you will be connecting the RAK4200 Breakout Board to The Things Network (TTN). If you don't have an account yet, head on to [TTN site](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and create one. Once done, log in to your account and go to the console. See the highlighted box in **Figure 4**.

#### Adding An Application

- Click the "**add application**" button

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-breakout-board/quickstart/ttn/application-input.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Adding an Application"
/>

Here are the things that you should take note of in adding an application:

1. **Application ID**: a unique ID on the TTN network that should be in lower case with no spaces
2. **Description**: This is a short and concise human-readable description of your application
3. **Application EUI**: automatically generated by TTN
4. **Handler Registration**: select the handler you want to register this application to

- After you fill in the necessary information, press the "**Add application**" button at the bottom of this page. If you see the following page, this means that you have successfully registered your application.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-breakout-board/quickstart/ttn/add-device.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Add your Device"
/>

Here are the things that you should take note of in registering your device:

1. **Device ID** - this is the unique identifier for your RAK4200 Breakout Board in your application. You need to enter this manually.
2. **Device EUI** - this is the unique identifier for your device in the network. You can change it later if you want.

Click the following icon, and the Device EUI will be automatically generated. The App Key should be in auto-generation mode by default.

- Lastly, click the Register button. Now, your device is registered under the corresponding application.

Depending on which authentication method you want to use, proceed to either the **OTAA mode** or **ABP mode** section.



#### OTAA Mode

When setting up a new device in TTN, its default is to join in OTAA mode. For configuration, you need the following three parameters: **Device EUI, Application EUI**, and **App Key**. You can get them all from the **Overview page**.

## Miscellaneous

### Firmware Update

Before you start working with the RAK4200, it is recommended to keep the RAK4200 module updated to the latest version of the firmware.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

For RAK4200 modules with firmware version V3.0.0.12 and below, you need to use the [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) to upgrade your firmware and upload the **.hex file** (not the .bin file) of the [latest RAK4200 firmware](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/#LoRa/RAK4200/Firmware/). The lower versions of the firmware have a different bootloader code and will not work on the RAK DFU Tool.

:::

In the following sections, two (2) options for flashing new firmware in a RAK4200 module are shown: ‚Äú**Firmware Upgrade through DAPLink**‚Äù and ‚Äú**Firmware Upgrade through UART1**‚Äù.

#### Firmware Upgrade Through DAPLink

Refer to [RAKDAP1 Flash and Debug Tool Quickstart Guide](/Product-Categories/Accessories/RAKDAP1-Flash-and-Debug-Tool).


#### Firmware Upgrade Through UART1

##### Minimum Hardware and Software Requirements

|               |                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Computer      | A Windows/Linux/Mac computer              |
| Firmware File | Bin firmware downloaded from the website. |
| Others        | A USB to TTL adapter.                     |

##### Firmware Upgrade Procedure

Follow this procedure to upgrade the firmware in Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) mode through the UART1 interface.

1. Download the latest application firmware of the [RAK4200 module](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/#LoRa/RAK4200/Firmware/).
2. Download the RAK Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) tool. In this folder are the different DFU tools depending on your machine's OS.
    - [RAK Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/#LoRa/Tools/RAK_Device_Firmware_Upgrade_tool/)
3. Connect the RAK4200 module with a computer through USB to TTL adapter, as shown in **Figure 18**:

4. Open the RAK Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) tool. Select the serial port and baud rate of the module, and then click on the "Select Port" button.
