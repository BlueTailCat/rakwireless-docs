# RAK5010-M WisTrio NB-IoT Tracker

Thank you for choosing **RAK5010-M-BG95 WisTrio NB-IoT Tracker** in your awesome IoT project! üéâ To help you get started, we have provided you with all the necessary documentation for your product.

* [Quick Start Guide](../Quickstart/)
* [Datasheet](../Datasheet/)
* [AT Command Manual](../AT-Command-Manual/)

:::tip üìù NOTE
**RAK5010-M-BG95** is an updated model of **RAK5010-M**. It uses the same circuit board and components except for the Quectel cellular modem used. The RAK5010-M-BG95 uses **BG95-M3** while the original RAK5010-M uses **BG96**. It shares the same AT commands set as well so if you are using the AT command interface, the two versions are compatible. If using a custom firmware (created with our RUI V2 or another IDE), you have to take into account that on the BG95-M3 you cannot use the cellular connection and the GNSS location acquisition at the same time. You have to stop the cellular connection before you can start the location acquisition.

## Product Description

The **RAK5010-M-BG95 WisTrio NB-IoT Tracker** is an advanced, highly flexible eMTC/NB-IoT/EGPRS tracker based on Quectel BG95-M3 (BG96 on the old model) LTE Cat M1&NB1, integrated with GPS, BLE, and a variety of sensors. The MCU running the board is a Nordic nRF52840 controller.

With the GPS and BLE features, the device can be used in a wide range of applications from outdoor to indoor scenarios where location-based services are necessary.

The board is equipped with two sensors on board: a humidity and temperature sensor and a 3-axis motion sensor. Additionally, the extension IOs in the module allow expandable sensor applications in addition to the onboard ones.

This board is particularly suitable to be used as a quick testing and prototyping tool for applications requiring NB-IoT connectivity. Application development supports the GCC environment.

## Product Features

- **Quectel BG95-M3** with LTE CAT M1, LTE NB1, EGPRS and GNSS
- **Nordic nRF52840**, with BLE 5.0 and long-range BLE
