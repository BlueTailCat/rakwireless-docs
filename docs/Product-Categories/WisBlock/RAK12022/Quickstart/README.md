- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino board, install the RAKwireless Arduino BSP. Follow the steps in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

RAK12022 is a PT100 IO module that uses MAX31865, an easy-to-use resistance-to-digital converter optimized for platinum resistance temperature detectors (RTDs).

For more information about RAK12022, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

RAK12022 module can be connected to the IO slot of the WisBlock Base to communicate with the WisBlock Core. Always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for the IO slot is properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [WisBlock Base board assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws, depending on the module.

When using the **RAK4631** board, connect the LoRa and BLE antennas to avoid damage to the board.

  caption="LoRa and BLE antennas of RAK4631"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock module is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 6**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK12022 uses SPI communication lines, and it can cause possible conflicts, especially on other WisBlock Modules connected to Slots A to F of the WisBlock Base.
:::

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the WisBlock Base board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.

### Software Configuration and Example

The RAK12022 design is based on **MAX31865** from Analog Devices. The RAK12022 is a PT100 IO module, an easy-to-use resistance-to-digital converter optimized for platinum resistance temperature detectors (RTDs). An external resistor sets the sensitivity for the RTD being used, and a precision delta-sigma ADC converts the ratio of the RTD resistance to the reference resistance into digital form. For this example, you will be using the **RAK4631** as your WisBlock Core.

#### Initial Test of the RAK12022 WisBlock Module

1. Before you do the initial test of the RAK12022 module, you need to assemble the PT100 sensor into the module. Different wiring configurations for the 4-wire PT100 sensor are shown in **Figures 7, 8, and 9**.

   **2-Wire**

  width="100%"
  caption="4-Wire Assembly"
/>

2. Once done with the configuration, install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index) for WisBlock by using the `package_rakwireless_index.json` board installation package. The WisBlock Core should now be available on the Arduino IDE.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you are using the RAK11200 as your WisBlock Core, the RAK11200 requires the **Boot0** pin to be configured properly first before uploading. If not done properly, uploading the source code to RAK11200 will fail. Check the full details on the [RAK11200 Quick Start Guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK11200/Quickstart/#uploading-to-wisblock).
:::

6. Then upload the code as shown in **Figure 18** and **Figure 19**.
