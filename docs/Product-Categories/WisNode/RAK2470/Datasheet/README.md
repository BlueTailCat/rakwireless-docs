### Hardware

The hardware specification covers only the interfacing and detailed parameters and functions of the RAK2470 WisNode Bridge Serial Prime.

#### Interfaces

The **RAK2470 WisNode Bridge Serial Prime** comes with an M12-4 circular connector (including power and RS485 data interfaces). The power interface needs to be powered by a DC power supply (5 ~ 12&nbsp;V) and the voltage must be stable.

In addition, the RS485 host baud rate is 115200, and multiple devices can be connected.

#### T-Type Conversion Cable

The RAK2470 comes with a 1&nbsp;m T-type conversion cable for each branch. Using this conversion cable, the RAK2470 can be connected to any RS485 equipped sensors, and power can be supplied to both the RAK2470 and the connected sensor via the DC power port.

As shown in the **Figure 3**, the T-type conversion cable consists of an L20-4 Four-core Straight-through Port for connecting RS485 sensors, an M12-4 Female-pin Port for connecting to the RAK2470, and a DC port for power supply.

## Connect to a Device

There are two ways to connect devices to RAK2470:

- When the device has its own power source (e.g. a MPPT solar charge controller), it can be directly connected to the connector on the RAK2470.
- When the device cannot provide power, it needs to be powered through the T-type conversion cable as follows:

  1. The Modbus device or RS485 sensor is connected to the L20-4 four-core straight-through port of the T-type conversion cable.
  2. RAK2470 connects to the M12-4 female-pin port (threaded) of the T-type conversion cable.
  3. The DC port for connection to a power supply.
