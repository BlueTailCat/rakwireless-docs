### Field Mapper Operating Modes

The Field Mapper can operate in different modes.

- [Plug and Play Mode](/Product-Categories/WisNode/RAK10701-H/Quickstart/#plug-and-play-mode)
- [Custom Mode](/Product-Categories/WisNode/RAK10701-H/Quickstart/#custom-mode)
- [Discovery Mode](/Product-Categories/WisNode/RAK10701-H/Quickstart/#discovery-mode)

:::tip üìù NOTE:
All these modes require you to be within Helium network coverage. Otherwise, the device will not be able to join the Helium network. The Helium network converge can be found on [Helium Explorer webpage](https://explorer.helium.com/).
:::

The active work mode (Plug-and-Play or Custom) of the Field Mapper can be found under settings. You have to click the settings icon to check the current mode.

<rk-img

  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak10701/quickstart/discovery_mode.png"
  width="35%"
  caption="RAK10701-H Discovery mode"
/>

#### Plug and Play Mode

On Plug and Play mode, the RAK10701-H Field Mapper automatically sends the uplink payload to the Helium network as long as it was able to join the network.

There is no EUI and KEY configuration needed since it is already on-boarded to the Helium network with the included data credits (DC). The only parameter that is critical to set is the regional band. This is dependent on your location. For example, if you are in Europe, it must be EU868 as shown in this guide. The complete regional frequency plans per country can be found on [Helium documentation on frequency plans](https://docs.helium.com/lorawan-on-helium/frequency-plans/#frequency-plans-by-country).

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak10701/quickstart/settings-band.png"
  width="35%"
  caption="RAK10701-H band settings"
/>

The Field Mapper must get a GPS fix to get valid data. The number of hotspots count will only update once the device sent a successful uplink and received a downlink coming from the server. If you are indoors, the device will not be able to get the satellite signals and won't have latitude and longitude coordinates.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak10701/quickstart/gps_fix.png"
  width="35%"
  caption="RAK10701-H GPS fix"
/>

You can also force an uplink even without a GPS fix by double-clicking on the external button at the side of RAK10701-H.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak10701/quickstart/forced-uplink.png"
  width="35%"
  caption="RAK10701-H force uplink"
/>

In plug-and-play mode, the Field Mapper is **automatically configured** to work on [Helium Cargo](https://cargo.helium.com/), [Coverage Map](https://coveragemap.net/heatmap) and [Helium Mapper](https://mappers.helium.com/). This allows you to quickly check your device by using its device name in real-time.

**Helium Cargo** - You can check your device by search input and it will filter all devices automatically. You can click on the name of your device and get more information.
<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak10701/quickstart/cargo.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="RAK10701 in Helium Cargo"
/>

**Coverage Map** - Under the `Advance maps`, you can directly check your device and see it on the coverage map.

#### Custom Mode

In Custom Mode, the RAK10701 can be manually registered to [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com/). This is a public LoRaWAN network server that you can use for your LoRaWAN end-devices. This guide shows each detail of how to prepare the Helium Console for your RAK10701 field mapper. There will be two dedicated on this mode - [Setting up of Helium Console](/Product-Categories/WisNode/RAK10701-H/Quickstart/#setting-up-of-the-helium-console) and [Configuration of RAK10701 via WisToolBox](/Product-Categories/WisNode/RAK10701-H/Quickstart/#configuration-of-rak10701-h-using-wistoolbox).

##### Setting up of the Helium Console

:::tip üìù NOTE:
This guide is based on [disk19 guide for the Field Mapper](https://github.com/disk91/WioLoRaWANFieldTester/blob/master/doc/ConfigureHelium.md) configuration for the Helium Console.
:::

1. You need to register an account and then purchase data credits (DC) to use the network. If you are a new user, there are free data credits (DC) included in your new account to get you started quickly.

/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak10701/quickstart/lcd-status-indicator.png"
  width="35%"
  caption="Different device status"
/>

**Status:**

- **IDLE**: RAK10701-H Field Mapper state is in between the previous uplink and the next uplink. The duration of IDLE depends on the interval configured on the device.
- **JOINING**: RAK10701-H Field Mapper is trying to join the network. This status is triggered when a Join request is sent.
- **JOINED**: RAK10701-H Field Mapper successfully received the Join accept the packet. This status will be displayed until refreshed when new data is sent.
- **FAILED**: RAK10701-H Field Mapper failed to join the network. Triggered by receive timeout. There might be no available gateway reachable by the Field Mapper.
- **SENDING**: RAK10701-H Field Mapper's data such as GPS is being uploaded via an uplink. It will be displayed until the reception is completed or timed out.

##### Settings

The field mapper has configurable parameters: Band, TX power, TX interval, backlight intensity, and DR. You can navigate the settings using the arrow widgets plus the back and ok buttons.
The OTAA parameters APPEUI, DEVEUI, and APPKEY are also displayed but can't be changed on the touchscreen. WisToolBox or another Serial Port terminal tool is needed to send the AT commands to update the EUIs and key.
