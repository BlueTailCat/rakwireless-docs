### Software

Download the latest firmware for the RAK3172 WisDuo Evaluation Board provided below. RAK3172(L) and RAK3172(H) use the same firmware and it will automatically detect the variant of the module being used.

The **bin file** contains the application code only and you need the RAK DFU Tool to upload this file to the module.

The **hex file** contains both the bootloader and the application code. You need to use STM32CubeProgrammer to upload this.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Uploading the `**.hex**` file via STM32CubeProgrammer will erase all configured data on the device.
:::

RAK3172 uses UART2's serial pins to upload the latest firmware.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
RAK3172 should automatically go to BOOT mode when the firmware is being uploaded via RAK DFU Tool or WisToolBox.

If BOOT mode is not initiated, you can manually send `AT+BOOT` command to start bootloader mode.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
There are RAK3172 devices loaded with old firmware versions which are not based on RUI3 (RAKwireless Unified Interface V3). These devices have v1.0.4 and below.

If the host microcontroller code is based on this old firmware, we have a [RAK3172 AT Command migration guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/AT-Migration-Guide/) that explain in detail the few differences between the two AT commands set.
