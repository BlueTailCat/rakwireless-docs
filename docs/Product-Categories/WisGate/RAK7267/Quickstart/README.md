## Product Configuration

### Installation

#### Insert SIM Card

If you will use a cellular network connection on your gateway, you can refer to this section. Otherwise, skip it.

1.  Start by removing the cover of the NanoSIM interface on the gateway Unify enclosure to expose the SIM card slot

3. Once completed, seal the interface cover.

#### Pole Mounting

This section provides the instructions on mounting and securing the mounting kit to the enclosure and the mounting pole.

1. Fix the pole mounts marked with the letter A on the gateway Unify enclosure using four (4) pieces of M3 x 8&nbsp;mm head screw with a washer. The fixed positions are shown in **Figure 5**.

### Power on the Gateway

In this section, it is assumed that you have read and performed the procedures listed in the **Installation** part of this document. RAK7267 supports solar battery system and 9~36&nbsp;V<sub>DC</sub> power supply. For outdoor deployment scenarios, it is recommended to use the RAK solar battery system for power supply. RAK7267 supports RAK9155 and RAK9154 solar battery systems as its power supply. To install the solar battery kits, you can refer to the <a href="https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Accessories/RAK9155/Quickstart/#overview" target="_blank">RAK9155 Quick Start Guide</a> and <a href="https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Accessories/RAK9154/Installation-Guide/" target="_blank">RAK9154 Solar Battery Installation Guide</a>.

:::tip üìù NOTE

The solar battery kits are not included in the package. They should be purchased separately.

### Access the Gateway

#### Connect Wi-Fi

For RAK7267, you need to access the gateway through Wi-Fi AP Mode. By default, the gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode, which means that you can find an SSID, named **RAK7267_XXXX** on your PC's Wi-Fi Network List. **XXXX** is the last two bytes of the Gateway MAC address. 

1. To access the Web Management Platform, input the following IP Address in your Web browser: `192.168.230.1`.

  width="70%"
  caption="Accessing the gateway via Wi-Fi AP mode"
/>


:::tip üìù NOTE

No password is required to connect via Wi-Fi.

:::


2. Using your preferred Web browser, input the aforementioned IP address and you should see the Login Page.

####  Set Login Password

1. For security reasons, upon the first log in, you must set a login password. This is done by filling in the desired password and confirming it in the provided fields. The password must meet the following requirements:

- At least 12 characters long.
- Has at least one special character (!‚Äú#$%&\‚Äò()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_`{|}~).
- Has at least one number.
- Has at least one standard Latin letter (used in the English alphabet).

2. You can either click the **Scan** button to choose your **ESSID** or manually type the ESSID of the network by clicking **enter network (E)SSID manually**.
3. Select the right **Encryption** method and enter the correct **Key**.

:::tip üìù NOTE
Assuming you have entered the correct parameter values, you should get an IP address assigned by your Wi-Fi router's (AP) built-in DHCP server. You can use this new IP address to log in via a web browser (the same way as in AP mode).

#### Connect Through Cellular

RAK7267 supports cellular connection. So you need to insert your SIM card first.

1. Access the gateway's Web UI. Navigate to **Network** > **WAN** > **Cellular**. Expand the Cellular block and click on **Settings**. Make sure the **Interface** is enabled.
