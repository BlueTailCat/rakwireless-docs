# WisMesh Base Quick Start Guide

WisMesh Base is a base board, ideal for creating your own Meshtastic node, simplifying assembly without requiring extra cables.

This guide covers the basics for the RAKwireless Meshtastic devices that are not covered by the <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/introduction/" target="_blank">Meshtastic documentation</a>.

For detailed instructions how to configure the devices for the Meshtastic network, follow the <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/" target="_blank">Meshtastic Getting Started</a> guide.

The Meshtastic Base is different from our other WisBlock Base Boards, as it has the RAK4630 module directly mounted on the Base Board.

## Product Configuration

### Overview

To give you a better understanding of how the WisMesh Base works, the block diagram and power supply diagram of RAK19026 are provided in this section.

#### Block Diagram

The block diagram in **Figure 1** shows the internal architecture and external interfaces of the RAK19026 WisMesh Base Board.


<rk-img

  width="90%"
  caption="RAK19026 WisMesh Base Board block diagram"
/>

The RAK4630 module on the WisMesh Base Boards is based on the Nordic nRF52840 MCU and the Semtech SX1262 LoRa transceiver. It offers the I2C, UART, and SPI data buses and GPIO's to the sensor modules. Through these buses, the MCU can control and retrieve data from the sensors.

Some MCU IO pins have an alternate function. In this case, you have the option to modify the IO via software or rework the hardware to redefine the function of IO. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4630-Module/Datasheet" target="_blank">WisDuo RAK4630 datasheet</a> to get all the details.

The RAK19026 is designed to be powered by a battery and has a charger circuitry for **lithium batteries**. The charger circuitry can be connected to a wall outlet charger through a Type-C USB connector, or the specific connector for a solar panel. The voltage coming from the Type-C USB port or solar panel connector goes only to a charger chip. The charger chip detects when to recharge the battery and stops charging when it is fully charged.  The output of the charger chip is used to supply the WisBlock modules via a step-down converter.

A switch between the battery output and the on-board DC-DC converter can power down the MCU and all sensor and IO modules. The charger chip remains active in the OFF position, allowing the battery to recharge through the USB port or solar connector.

A high-efficiency step-down converter with a low quiescent current is used to generate 3.3&nbsp;V. This 3.3&nbsp;V power supply drives the consumption of the WisBlock Core module and the sensor modules. The max current supported by the 3.3&nbsp;V LDO is 750&nbsp;mA.

3V3_S is another 3.3&nbsp;V power supply, it can be controlled by the MCU to disconnect the power sensors during idle periods to save power. 3V3_S is controlled by the IO2 pin on the WisBlock Core board.

- Set **IO2=1**, 3V3_S is on.
- Set **IO2=0**, 3V3_S is off.


### Hardware Setup

#### RAK19026 WisMesh Base Board Installation Guide

RAK19007 WisBlock Base Board is the main board with an onboard RAK4630 WisDuo module. It allows you to attach WisBlock sensors, and IO modules through the standardized expansion connectors. These connectors provide a data bus interconnection between the modules attached to the RAK19026 Base Board.

This guide shows the details related to the installation of modules into the RAK19026 board. The following section discusses the general concepts to manipulate the WisBlock Connector in any WisBlock Module. The installation and removal details of each type of WisBlock module: Core and Sensor are explained.

##### Attaching a WisBlock Connector

The WisBlock Connector is the interface between the RAK19026 board and the WisBlock Core, Sensor, and IO modules. Before connecting these modules, read the following instructions:

:::tip üìù NOTE
This guide uses two arrows. Refer to **Figure 2** for its representation.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19007/quickstart/1.arrows.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="Notation within the guide"
/>

1. Align the connectors. Keep the header parallel and place it lightly in the corresponding lap joint of the socket.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19007/quickstart/2.alignment.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Alignment of WisBlock Connector"
/>

2. Fit the connector. Tilt one end of the connector (header) less than 20 degrees, gently place the other end parallel without applying force.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19007/quickstart/3.header-to-socket.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Fit the WisBlock Connector‚Äôs header inside of the socket"
/>

3. After the above alignment steps, the header and socket are matched but still not buckled.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19007/quickstart/4.header-matched.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="WisBlock Connector‚Äôs header matched inside of the socket"
/>

4. Apply forces evenly by pressing in parallel, then there will be a sound confirming the completion of the buckling.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19007/quickstart/5.buckle-the-head.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Apply forces to buckle the heard to the socket "
/>

5. In the process of buckling and applying force, avoid the application of uneven force on both sides.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19007/quickstart/6.uneven-forces.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Avoid applying uneven forces"
/>

6. When the buckling process is completed, check that the header and socket are kept in parallel.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19007/quickstart/7.buckle-header-to-socket.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Correct way to buckle the WisBlock Connector‚Äôs header to the socket"
/>

7. If after buckling, the header and socket are not in a parallel state (not fully assembled in one place), then press the even force on both sides of the long side to complete the correct buckling.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19007/quickstart/8.not-parallel.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="WisBlock Connector‚Äôs header is not parallel to the socket"
/>

8. When the aforementioned steps are not completed yet, do not apply force to buckle. Otherwise, there will be a risk to damage the connector. When the connector cannot be smoothly buckled down, repeat the alignment step.

##### Detaching a WisBlock Connector

1. To disconnect the header from the socket, pull out in parallel with even forces.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19007/quickstart/9.detach-header.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Correct way: Applying even forces to detach the header from the socket"
/>

2. Avoid pulling out the header asymmetrically in the long-side direction.

  width="60%"
  caption="Wrong way: Applying uneven forces to detach the header from the socket"
/>

3. The short-side of the connector can be pulled out asymmetrically, but apply the force vertically and avoid rotating the header.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak19007/quickstart/11.dont-rotate.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Wrong way: Do not rotate the header"
/>

4. Avoid applying forces in a single corner.
