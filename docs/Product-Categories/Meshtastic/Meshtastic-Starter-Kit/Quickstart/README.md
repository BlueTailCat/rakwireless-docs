# Meshtastic WisMesh Starter Kit Quick Start Guide

WisMesh Starter Kit is a versatile DIY Kit, ideal for DIY enthusiasts. Ideal for users looking for a hassle-free Meshtastic node.

This guide covers the basics for the Meshtastic Starter Kit that are not handled by the <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/introduction/" target="_blank">Meshtastic documentation</a>.

For detailed instructions how to configure the devices for the Meshtastic network, follow the <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/" target="_blank">Meshtastic Getting Started</a> guide.

::: tip üìù NOTE
To be sure to run the latest version of the Meshtastic firmware, we advice you to download the <a href="https://meshtastic.org/downloads" target="_blank">latest Meshtastic firmware</a> and upload it to your RAKwireless device to make it compatible with the Meshtastic network.

For Firmware 1.3 and 2.0 (from November 1, 2022), the WisBlock Base board is autodetected. There's a special firmware if you have the <a href="https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-epd-module-rak14000" target="_blank">RAK14000 WisBlock E-Ink Display</a> connected. All other use cases are covered in the stock firmware.

### Software

The WisBlock Core module of the Meshtastic Starter Kit comes pre-flashed with the Meshtastic firmware.

However to connect the device to the Meshtastic network you will have to configure it. There are several applications for the configuration:
- <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/category/android-app/" target="_blank">Android App</a>
- <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/category/apple-apps/" target="_blank">Apple App</a>
- <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/web-client/" target="_blank">Web Client</a>
- <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/python/cli/" target="_blank">Python CLI</a>

::: tip üìù NOTE
Make sure that you have installed one of these applications, as they are required for the configuration of the Meshtastic network.

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

#### RAK4631 to WisBlock Base

The Meshtastic Starter Kit comes with the RAK4631 module already assembled on the WisBlock Base board. The WisBlock Base provides a USB connection for programming the RAK4631. It also provides a power source and various interfaces to RAK4631 so that it can be connected to other WisBlock modules via different module slots.

In case you need to change the RAK4631 or install additional modules, this guide illustrates how the RAK4631 can be connected to RAK19007 WisBlock Base, as shown in **Figure 1**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
Assembly of the RAK4631 on other Base Boards is performed in the same way.
Assembly guides for other modules can be found in the Quick Start Guides of these modules.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

**Figure 2** shows how to mount the RAK4631 module on top of a WisBlock Base board (RAK19007). Follow carefully the procedure defined in <a href="https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/" target="_blank">WisBlock module assembly/disassembly instructions</a> in order to secure the connection safely. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same.

1. Start by removing the screws.

  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 3,** to detach the module from the baseboard.

#### LoRa and BLE Antenna

Another important part component of Meshtastic Starter kit are the antennas.

For LoRa, two antennas are included.    
1. A 2&nbsp;dBi rubber antenna with a RP-SMA connector and an IPEX-to-RP-SMA pigtail cable.

<rk-img

  caption="LoRa Antenna"
/>    
2. A LoRa PCB antenna that can be connected directly to the RAK4631
<rk-img

  caption="LoRa PCB Antenna"
/>
3. A BLE PCB antenna that can be connected directly to the RAK4631
<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/ble-antenna.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="BLE PCB Antenna"
/>

You need to ensure that the antenna is properly connected to have a good LoRa signal. Do not power the module without an antenna connected to the IPEX connector to avoid damage to the RF section of the chip.

RAK4631 has a label on its sticker where to connect the antennas, as shown in **Figure 9**.

:::tip üìù NOTE
Detailed information about the RAK4631 BLE and LoRa antenna can be found on the <a href="https://downloads.rakwireless.com/#LoRa/WisBlock/Accessories/" target="_blank">antenna datasheet</a>.
:::

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
When using the LoRa or Bluetooth Low Energy transceivers, make sure that an antenna is always connected. Using these transceivers without an antenna can damage the system. Make sure to fix the module with the screws to ensure a proper function.
