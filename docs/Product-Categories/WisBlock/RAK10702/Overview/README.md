### Product Description

The **RAK10702 WisBlock Indoor Comfort Node** is an indoor air quality sensor kit. It features measurement of CO2, particulate matter, VOC (volatile organic components), temperature, humidity, and light and has in addition a PIR sensor to detect room occupancy.

It is a feature-packed air quality sensing device for application development. This device can be used as a quick prototyping tool for Internet-of-Things (IoT) and LoRaWAN Integration. The Indoor Comfort Node comes with an open-source firmware that covers all sensors and functionality. If this firmware doesn't cover your needs, you can use it as a base to develop your firmware.

### Product Features

- Supports sleep mode, low power consumption
- **Nordic nRF52840 MCU** combined with the **Semtech SX1262** LoRa transceiver for powerful, yet low-power applications and additional BLE functionality.
- **Sensirion SCD30 CO2 Sensor**: CO2 sensor with a measurement range from 400&nbsp;ppm to 10,000&nbsp;ppm and an accuracy of Â±(30&nbsp;ppm + 3%)
- **Plantower PM sensor**: Particle Matter Sensor module allows to capture standard PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10 values.
- **Sensirion SGP40 VOC Sensor**: Detects a wide range of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) with a measurement range of 0 to 1000&nbsp;ppm (Ethanol in clean air), combined with the Sensorion VOC algorithms it delivers a VOC index from 0 to 500.
- **Vishay Semiconductor VEML7700 Light Sensor**: Can measure light exposure with an ambient light range from 0 lx to about 120,000&nbsp;lx with a resolution of 0.0036 lx.

- **Senba Technology AM312 PIR Sensor**: Detects occupancy and motion from infrared radiated objects.
- **RGB LED**: Shows the air quality status in 3 levels.
- **Micro Crystal RV-3028-C7 RTC Module**: Keeps the real-time accurate on the device.
- **Button**: To switch between display variants, enable BLE for debug or firmware updates and show hardware device information
- LoRaWAN 1.0.2 Standard support - ABP or OTAA mode
- LoRa P2P support
- LoRa and BLE antenna are integrated inside the casing
- Micro USB for configuration
- Supports global license-free frequency band: RU864, IN865, EU868, RU864, US915, AU915, KR920, and AS923
- (_**Optional**_) **E-Ink Display**: Shows the current values of all integrated sensors, with a resolution of 400x300&nbsp;pixel
- (_**Optional**_) **3D printed enclosure in SLS quality**: Perfect protection for the Indoor Comfort Node with a flexible mounting option
- (_**Optional**_) **Open-sourced enclosure design for 3D printed enclosures**: Enclosure design available in different 3D formats to either print your enclosure or use it as a base for your enclosure design
