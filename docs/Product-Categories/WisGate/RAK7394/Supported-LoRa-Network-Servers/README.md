# RAK7394 Supported LoRa Network Servers

## Connecting to The Things Stack (TTNv3)

The Things Network is enabling low-power devices to use long-range gateways to connect to an open-source, decentralized network to exchange data through an Application. Learn more about the Things Network through their [documentation](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/).

In this section, you will learn how to connect RAK7394/RAK7394C/RAK7394P WisGate Developer CM4 gateway to TTNv3.

1. To log in to the TTNv3, head on to the [TTN site](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/). If you already have a TTN account, you can use your The Things ID credentials to log in.

2. First, you should have connected your gateway to the internet through the router according to the method which has been introduced in the **Accessing the Internet** section of the Quick Start Guide.

3. Secondly, config your gateway and choose TTN as the LoRa Server and choose the correct frequency according to the method which has been introduced in the **Configuring the Gateway** section of the Quick Start Guide.

4. Click on **Start building** and choose the cluster that is geographically closest to your region.

- **Owner**- Automatically filled by The Things Stack, based on your account or created Organization.
- **Gateway ID** - This will be the unique ID of your gateway in the Network. Note that the ID must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes (-).
- **Gateway EUI** - A 64-bit extended unique identifier for your gateway. The gateway's EUI can be found by running either one of the following commands in the CLI of the gateway:

```
gateway-version
```

```
sudo gateway-config
```

- **Gateway description (optional)** - Optional gateway description; can also be used to save notes about the gateway.

- **Gateway Server address** - The address of the gateway server to connect to.

:::tip üìù NOTE
- This tutorial is based on using the EU868 frequency band, so the server address will be: **eu1.cloud.thethings.network**.
- The **Europe 863-870&nbsp;MHz (SF12 for RX2)** is used.
:::

- **Frequency plan** - The frequency plan used by the gateway.

- The other settings are optional and can be changed to satisfy your requirements.

When the gateway is configured to TTN and is successfully registered in the console, it will show up online.

## Connecting the Gateway with ChirpStack

The ChirpStack is an open-source LoRaWAN Network Server. To learn more, refer to the [ChirpStack site](https://www.chirpstack.io/).

When it comes to RAK7394/RAK7394C/RAK7394P WisGate Developer CM4 gateway, there are two (2) ways to use the ChirpStack:

### Using the Built-in ChirpStack

There is a built-in ChirpStack in every RAK Developer gateway if you use the latest firmware or the `rak_common_for_gateway` repository.

- When you use it for the first time after burning the latest firmware, the gateway will work in the **EU868 Band** and it will use the built-in ChirpStack as its default LoRa Server. If you don't want to change the frequency or LoRa Server, you don't have to do anything as this will be configured automatically when the gateway boots.

- However, if it is not the first time you use the gateway and you want to use the built-in ChirpStack as the LoRa Server, follow the steps discussed in Configuring the Gateway section.

- **Optional** - If ever you disabled the **AP Mode** and you have connected it to your Wifi network **(Client Mode)**, you can search for your gateway‚Äôs IP Address via [Advanced IP Scanner](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/).

- There is a **Web-based UI** that comes with the ChirpStack instance. Simply open a browser and enter the following credentials:

  - **Browser Address**: `<Gateway IP address>:8080` (Example: `http://192.168.0.100:8080`)
  - **Username**: admin
  - **Password**: admin

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
It is advisable to **change your password** to tighten the security of your account. You can change this by clicking the change password button at the user icon.
:::

src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7394/supported-lora-network-servers/6.chirpstack-ui.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="ChirpStack web-based UI"
/>

- Everything should be pre-configured - **Device profiles** have been created, the gateway has been registered with the server, etc. If you go to the **Gateways tab** and click on **rak_gateway**, you should see the gateway details page.

<rk-img
src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7394/supported-lora-network-servers/7.available-gateway.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Available gateway in Chirpstack"
/>

- Go to **Gateways** and see the **Last seen status**. It must be a few seconds ago, which signifies that the gateway is visible in the ChirpStack server.

<rk-img
src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7394/supported-lora-network-servers/8.seen-status.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Last seen status"

### Using an Independent ChirpStack

You can set up an independent ChirpStack by yourself and set up a ChirpStack in AWS. Refer to the [AWS guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/Amazon-Web-Services/). If you want to run ChirpStack on a different host/cloud, then refer to the [guide](https://www.chirpstack.io/guides/debian-ubuntu/) on the ChirpStack site.


:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Remember to run the `sudo gateway-config` command in the CLI and point the gateway to the IP address of the machine you just installed ChirpStack on. This can be done in item 2 in the menu **Setup RAK Gateway LoRa concentrator**.
:::

- Assuming you have set it up correctly, log into your ChirpStack to register your gateway by opening the ChirpStack's web page in a browser by entering:

    - **Browser Address**: `<IP Address of ChirpStack>:8080`
    - **Username**: admin
    - **Password**: admin

<rk-img
src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7394/supported-lora-network-servers/9.login-page.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="ChirpStack login page"
/>

- Click **Gateways** and select **+ CREATE** to register your gateway

<rk-img
src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7394/supported-lora-network-servers/10.registered-gateways.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="ChirpStack registered gateways"

- After registering your gateway, fill in the necessary information.

<rk-img
src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7394/supported-lora-network-servers/11.fill-in.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Filling in the details"
/>

- Fill in the gateway ID that you got from the **Configuring the Gateway** section, also called gateway EUI.

- If you have properly configured your gateway and there is a network connection between the external ChirpStack and your gateway, you should see the same page and status, as shown in **Figure 12**.

## AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN

Execute the following steps to set up your AWS account and permissions.

### Set Up Your AWS Account and Permissions

If you don't have an AWS account, refer to the instructions in the guide here. The relevant sections are **Sign up for an AWS account** and **Create a user and grant permissions**.

#### Overview

The high-level steps to get started with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN are as follows:

1. Set up Roles and Policies in IAM
2. Add a Gateway (see section [Add the Gateway to AWS IoT](#add-the-gateway-to-aws-iot))
3. Add Device(s) (see section [Add a LoRaWAN Device to AWS IoT](#add-a-lorawan-device-to-aws-iot))
    - Verify device and service profiles
    - Set up a Destination to which device traffic will be routed and processed by a rule.

These steps are discussed as you browse through this guide. For additional details, refer to the AWS LoRaWAN developer guide.

#### Add the Gateway to AWS IoT

##### Preparation

Refer to the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-onboard-gateways.html) for steps required before onboarding your gateway. For more details, check the software section of the [datasheet](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7248/Datasheet/#software).

##### Frequency Band Selection and Role Setup

Refer to the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-rfregion-permissions.html) for information on selecting an appropriate frequency band.

::: tip üìù NOTE
LoRa Frequency bands supported by RAK7248 are as follows:
- RU864
- IN865
- EU868
- US915
- AU915
- KR920
- AS923
- CN470

You can select an appropriate frequency band from the [RAK store](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak7248).
:::

##### Add the LoRaWAN Gateway

To register the gateway with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN, follow the steps in the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-onboard-gateway-add.html) under the **Add a gateway using the console** section.

#### Add a LoRaWAN Device to AWS IoT

##### Preparation

- Go to the datasheet to learn more about the [RAK4631 WisBlock LPWAN Module](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631/Datasheet/#rak4631-wisblock-lpwan-module-datasheet).
- Follow the steps in the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-onboard-end-devices.html) under the **Before onboarding your wireless device** section, then proceed to the [Add your wireless device to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-end-devices-add.html) section.

##### Verify Profiles

AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN supports device profiles and service profiles.  Device profiles contain the communication and protocol parameter values the device needs to communicate with the network server. Service profiles describe the communication parameters the device needs to communicate with the application server.

Some pre-defined profiles are available for device and service profiles.  Before proceeding, verify that these profile settings match the devices you will be setting up to work with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN. For more details, refer to the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-define-profiles.html) under the **Add profiles to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN** section.

::: tip üìù NOTE
Proceed only if you have a device and service profile that will work for you.
:::

##### Set Up a Destination for Device Traffic

Because most LoRaWAN devices don't send data to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN in a format that can be consumed by AWS services, traffic must first be sent to a Destination. A Destination represents the AWS IoT rule that processes a device's data for use by AWS services. This AWS IoT rule contains the SQL statement that selects the device's data and the topic rule actions that send the result of the SQL statement to the services that will use it.

For more information, refer to the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-create-destinations.html) under sections **Add a destination using the console** and **Create an IAM role for your destinations**. Also, refer to **Create rules to process LoRaWAN device messages** section in the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-create-destinations.html).

### Set Up the Gateway

#### Configure the Gateway Device

1. To connect to the AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN, you need to download and compile **Basics Station**.
Assuming that you have successfully accessed the gateway via SSH, it is a good policy to update/upgrade. Doing so, it will update all the packages:

```
sudo apt update
```

```
sudo apt upgrade
```

2. Now, register the gateway in AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN. To register your gateway, you will need the device‚Äôs EUI. To find the gateway‚Äôs EUI, run the command below to open the Graphics User Interface (GUI). The EUI can be found on the top of the GUI:

```
sudo gateway-config
```

<rk-img
src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7394/supported-lora-network-servers/13.gateway-id.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="RAK7248 Configuration Options"
/>

You can also run the following command:

```
pi@rak-gateway:~ $ sudo gateway-version
Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.1, OS "10 (buster)", 5.4.79-v7l+.
RAKwireless gateway RAK7248 no LTE version 4.2.7R install from firmware
Gateway ID: DCA632FFFE366417
```

3. Only the configuration of the Basics Station remains. Clone the Basics Station repository and enter the downloaded folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/lorabasics/basicstation.git
cd basicstation
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Run the following commands in the **Basics Station** directory.
:::

4. Install all the dependencies by running the following command:

```
make platform=corecell variant=std
```

5. Replace the file `loragw_stts751.c` using the following command:

```
sudo cp -f /opt/ttn-gateway/sx1302_hal/libloragw/src/loragw_stts751.c deps/lgw1302/platform-corecell/libloragw/src/loragw_stts751.c
```

6. Make a clean build in the Basics Station directory, and then do a `make` to install all dependencies with the changes.

```
make clean
make platform=corecell variant=std
```

7. As the installation is complete, you need to configure the Basics Station protocol. Enter the folder with the given examples by Semtech and specifically the corecell folder as the build is for SX1302.

```
cd examples/corecell
```

8. First, change the reset pin in the `reset_gw.sh` to 17 to successfully start the concentrator.

```
#!/bin/sh

# This script is intended to be used on the SX1302 CoreCell platform, it performs the following actions:
#        - export/unexport GPI023 and GPI018 used to reset the SX1302 chip and to enable the LDOs
#
# Usage examples:
#       ./reset_lgw.sh stop
#       ./reset_lgw.sh start
#
# GPIO mapping has to be adopted with HW
#

SX1302_RESET_PIN=17
SX1302_POWER_EN_PIN=18

WAIT_GPIO() {
    sleep 0.1
}
```

9. Create a new folder to store all the configuration files for Basics Station to connect to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN.

```
mkdir lns-aws
```

10. Copy `station.conf` into this folder.

```
cp lns-ttn/station.conf lns-aws/
```

11. Add the certificates that you downloaded earlier to **lns-aws**. (Refer to [Add the LoRaWAN Gateway](#add-the-lorawan-gateway).)

<rk-img

<rk-img
src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7394/supported-lora-network-servers/15.provisioning-credentials.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Provisioning credentials"
/>

12.  All the configurations for the Basics Stations are ready. You should now have the files as follows:

```
pi@rak-gateway:~/basicstation/examples/corecell/lns-aws $ ls -al
total 28
drwxr-xr-x 2 pi pi 4096 Oct 28 17:57 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 pi pi 4096 Oct 28 17:44 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 1225 Oct 28 17:57 cups.crt
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 1680 Oct 28 17:57 cups.key
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 1607 Oct 28 17:57 cups.trust
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi   69 Oct 28 17:57 cups.uri
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 2460 Oct 28 17:46 station.conf
```

13. Before you start using the Basics Station, disable the packet forwarder.
Use the command `sudo systemctl edit ttn-gateway.service` to edit the service of the packet forwarder, and add the following codes to the file.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
If you want to re-activate the packet forwarder, you can just set the value of **Restart** to **always**.
:::

```
[Unit]
Description=The Things Network Gateway

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/opt/ttn-gateway/packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/
ExecStart=/opt/ttn-gateway/packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/start.sh
SyslogIdentifier=ttn-gateway
Restart=no
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

14. To apply the changes made to the unit, execute the following command:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

15. Restart the ttn-gateway service to load the new service configuration. The unit file must be restated if you modify the running unit file.

```
sudo systemctl restart ttn-gateway.service
```

16. Find the ttn-gateway process PID and `kill` this process:

```
pi@rak-gateway:~/basicstation/example/corecell/lns-aws $ ps aux | grep ttn-gateway
pi      28165   0.2     0.1     7680        2780    pts/0   S+  18:20   0:00 /bin/bash/opt/ttn-gateway/packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/start.sh
pi      28236   0.0     0.0     7348         488    pts/1   S+  18:20   0:00 grep --color=auto ttn-gateway
pi@rak-gateway:~/basicstation/example/corecell/lns-aws $ sudo kill 28165
```

17. Now, you can start Basics Station. Exit the configuration folder and start Basics Station.

```
cd ..
./start-station.sh ‚Äìl lns-aws/
```

If everything is configured properly, your gateway should be online in the AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN console:

<rk-img
src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7394/supported-lora-network-servers/17.lorawan-specific-details.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Connected Status in the LoRaWAN Console"
/>

### Add End-Devices

Refer to [RAK4631 Quick Start Guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631/Quickstart/) to enable communication with the gateway.

#### Connect the Device and Verify the Connection Status

Follow the instructions in the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-device-connection-status.html) to connect your device to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN. To verify the connection status, refer to the instructions in the **Check device connection status using the console** section. You can also check [View format of uplink messages sent from LoRaWAN devices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-uplink-metadata-format.html).

### Verifying Operation

Once setup is completed, provisioned OTAA devices can join the network and start to send messages. Messages from devices can then be received by AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN and forwarded to the IoT Rules Engine.

Instructions for a sample Hello World application are shown in **Figure 18**, assuming that the device has joined and is capable of sending uplink traffic.

<rk-img
src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7394/supported-lora-network-servers/18.architecture.jpg"

  # Low Power Payload Reference: https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/ DATA_TYPES = 1
  # Type Temperature TYPE_TEMP = 0x67
  # setup iot-data client for boto3 client = boto3.client('iot-data') # setup logger
  logger = logging.getLogger(FUNCTION_NAME) logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

  def decode(event):
  data_base64 = event.get('PayloadData') data_decoded = base64.b64decode(data_base64) result = {
  'devEui': event.get('WirelessMetadata').get('LoRaWAN'
  ).get('DevEui'),
  'fPort': event.get('WirelessMetadata').get('LoRaWAN'
  ).get('FPort'),
  'freq': event.get('WirelessMetadata').get('LoRaWAN'
  ).get('Frequency'),
  'timestamp': event.get('WirelessMetadata').get('LoRaWAN'
  ).get('Timestamp'),
  }

  if data_decoded[DATA_TYPES] == TYPE_TEMP: temp = data_decoded[DATA_TYPES + 1] << 8 \
  | data_decoded[DATA_TYPES + 2] temp = ctypes.c_int16(temp).value result['temperature'] = temp / 10

  return result



  def lambda_handler(event, context): data = decode(event)
  logger.info('Data: %s' % json.dumps(data))
  response = client.publish(topic=event.get('WirelessMetadata'
