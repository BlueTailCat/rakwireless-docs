# RAK4270 WisDuo LPWAN Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK4270 LoRa Module includes an **STM32L071 MCU** and an **SX1262** LoRa chip, which supports eight (8) spreading factors (SF5 ~ SF12) and signal bandwidth that can be adjusted between 7.8&nbsp;kHz to 500&nbsp;kHz. It has Ultra-Low Power Consumption of 2.31&nbsp;ŒºA (down to 1.61&nbsp;ŒºA @ 2.0&nbsp;V) in sleep mode, but during the Transmit Mode, it can reach the maximum output power of 22&nbsp;dBm. As a receiver, it can achieve a sensitivity of -148&nbsp;dBm.

The module complies with Class A and C of LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specifications, and it also supports LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communications. The module is suitable for various applications that require long-range data acquisition and low power consumption, such as smart meters, supply chain and logistics tracking, agricultural sensors, and smart cities.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
When using `RF` pin for antenna and not the IPEX connector variant, there are design considerations to make sure optimum RF performance.

- RF trace must be away from interference (switching node of DC-DC supply, high current/voltage pulses from controllers of inductive load like motor, signal generators, etc.)
- RF trace must have 50&nbsp;Ohms impedance. It is advisable to use an impedance simulation software tool to achieve this requirement.
- If using an external antenna connector, make it close to the `RF` pin.
- Ground plane optimization is critical on certain antenna types like monopole.
- GND trace used for RF path return must be directly connected to the GND plane and not be treated as thermal relief.
- It is recommended for the RF trace to be routed in a curve and not in a sharp 90&nbsp;degrees.

##### SWD Programming Tool

To upgrade the firmware, the SWD (Serial Wire Debug) interface must be used. A 5-pin JLINK cable has to be connected to the SWD port. These pins are 3v3, GND, SWDIO, SWCLK, and MCU_NRST.


##### UARTS Ports

There are two UART ports on the RAK4270 module. UART2 (pin1 and pin2) can be used as the AT command port, while UART1 (pin4 and pin5) can be used both as AT command port and firmware upgrade port. It is recommended to connect the UART2 port to an external MCU and reserve UART1 for debugging and or future firmware upgrade purposes.

##### I2C Port

The RAK4270 exposes an I2C port, in which the SDA line is assigned to pin9, and the SCL line is assigned to pin10. This I2C port allows you to control additional slave sensors with the RAK4270 using the I2C protocol. The RAK4270 will be the master. If the I2C port is used, then external pull-up resistors must be added to the SDA and SCL lines. The recommended value of the resistors is 10&nbsp;kŒ©. You can develop your own firmware or use the [RUI (RAKwireless Unified Interface) Online compiler](/RUI/) to use this port.

##### RF Port

The RAK4270 module exposes two types of RF antenna: IPEX and PAD. The most straightforward way is to use the IPEX antenna port. In such a case, you just connect the antenna to the IPEX connector on the module directly. On the other hand, for specific needs, you can design a PCB trace antenna, Chip antenna, SMA antenna, or spring type antenna. In the latter case, you should use the PAD-type antenna port exposed by this module. The external antenna should be matched to the 50&nbsp;Œ© RF transmission line.

##### VDD Power In

It is recommended to add four decoupling capacitors near the RAK4270 power supply pins. The recommended values of the capacitors are two 10&nbsp;uF and two 100&nbsp;nF connected in parallel.
