## Product Description

The **RAK2287** is an LPWAN Concentrator Module with a mini-PCIe form factor based on Semtech SX1302, facilitating easy integration into an existing router or other network equipment with LPWAN Gateway capabilities. It can be utilized in any embedded platform offering a free mini-PCIe slot with SPI connection. Additionally, the **ZOE-M8Q GPS chip** is integrated on board.

This module offers an exceptional, comprehensive, and cost-efficient gateway solution. It provides up to 10 programmable parallel demodulation paths, an 8 x 8 channel LoRa packet detector, 8 x SF5-SF12 LoRa demodulators, and 8 x SF5-SF10 LoRa demodulators. 

Additionally, RAK2287 can detect an uninterrupted combination of packets at 8 different spreading factors and 10 channels. It can continuously demodulate up to 16 packets, making it suitable for smart metering fixed networks and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. It can cover up to 500 nodes per km¬≤ in an environment with moderate interference.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
- **Brand-New, Not Repurposed**: RAK modules are 100% new, unlike some excess inventory on the market.
- **Industrial-Grade Quality**: Designed and tested for the highest reliability in industrial applications.
- **Consistent Pricing**: Fair and stable prices without sacrificing quality.
- **Certified Compliance**: Fully certified with CE, REACH, RoHS, FCC, ISED, ANATEL, KC, and NCC standards.
