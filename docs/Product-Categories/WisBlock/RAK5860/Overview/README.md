## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK5860**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** is the power supply for the **RAK5860** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to use the sensor.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
* A battery connected to the WisBlock Base is required. USB power is not enough to make the module work reliably.
* You must be in an area or location where LTE-M and NB-IoT service is available. Otherwise, RAK5860 will not work.
* When using the BG77 Cellular modules, always make sure that an antenna is connected. Using the transceiver without an antenna can damage the system.
* The included active GPS antenna must be connected to the iPEX antenna connector on the board. Otherwise, the module will not work.
* Make sure to fix the module with screws to ensure proper function.
