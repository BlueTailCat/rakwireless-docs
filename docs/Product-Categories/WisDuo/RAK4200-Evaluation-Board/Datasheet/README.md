##### SWD Programming Interface

When programming via a DAPLink tool, it is required to have all of the following four (4) pins connected to your DAPLink tool:

1. **3V3**
2. **SWDIO**
3. **SWCLK**
4. **GND**

:::tip üìù NOTE:
For the aforementioned reason, it is best you leave these pins exposed for programming purposes and not to remap them as GPIOs.
:::

###### Flash the Firmware Using DAPLink and RAKDAP1

Refer to section [RAKDAP1-Flash-and-Debug-Tool](/Product-Categories/Accessories/RAKDAP1-Flash-and-Debug-Tool)

Use **Figure 3** as a guide to connect RAKDAP1 on RAK4200 Evaluation Board.

##### USB Interface

The Micro-B USB connector is compliant with the USB 2.0 specification. The pin definition of the USB interface is shown below:

| **Pin Number** | **Pin Name** | **Description**             |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| 1              | USB_VBUS     | (+5&nbsp;V) USB Bus Voltage |

##### Solar Panel Connector

A 5&nbsp;V solar panel can be connected to the board via a P2 connector to serve the purpose of charging the battery. The solar panel is not included on RAK4200 Evaluation Board packaging. Use **Figure 9** as a guide to connect the solar panel. The red triangle indicates pin 1.

##### LEDs

- üî¥ **Red LED** - connected to the charger chip to indicate the charger status. When the battery is charging, this red LED is on. When the battery is full, this LED is weak light or off.

##### RESET Button

The reset push button is connected to the NRST PA0 pin of the RAK4200. When pushed, it resets the MCU.

#### RF Requirements

##### Operating Frequencies

The RAK4200 has two different models based on its frequency: RAK4200(L) for low frequency and RAK4200(H) for high frequency.
