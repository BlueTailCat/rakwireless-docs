# RAK3272S Breakout Board Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

RAK3272S Breakout Board is specifically designed to allow easy access to the pins on the board in order to simplify development and testing. The breakout board footprint is based on the XBee form factor, and its main purpose is to allow the RAK3172 stamp module pins to be transferred to 2.54&nbsp;mm headers.

The board itself has the RAK3172 at its core, integrating a STM32WLE5CC chip. It has Ultra-Low Power Consumption of 1.69&nbsp;uA in sleep mode.

This module complies with Class A, B, & C of LoRaWAN 1.0.3 specifications. It also supports LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communication mode, which helps you in implementing your own customized long-range LoRa network quickly.

### Software

Download the latest firmware of the RAK3272S Breakout Board provided below. RAK3272SL and RAK3272S use the same firmware, and it will automatically detect the variant of the module being used.

The **bin file** contains the application code only and you need the RAK DFU Tool to upload this file to the module.

The **hex file** contains both the bootloader and the application code. You need to [use STM32CubeProgrammer to upload](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/STM32Cube-Programmer-Guide/) this.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Uploading the **`.hex`** file via STM32CubeProgrammer will erase all configured data on the device.
:::

RAK3272S uses UART2 serial pins to upload the latest firmware.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
RAK3272S should automatically go to BOOT mode when the firmware is uploaded via RAK DFU Tool or WisToolBox.

If BOOT mode is not initiated, you can manually send `AT+BOOT` command to start bootloader mode.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
There are RAK3172 devices loaded with old firmware versions which are not based on RUI3 (RAKwireless Unified Interface V3). These devices have v1.0.4 and below.

If the host microcontroller code is based on this old firmware, refer to [RAK3172 AT Command migration guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/AT-Migration-Guide/), which explains in detail the few differences between the two AT commands set.
