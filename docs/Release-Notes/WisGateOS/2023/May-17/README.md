::: tip üìù NOTE
As of March 2021, all RAK's WisGate Edge gateways are running the new WisGateOS. This also requires a change in the version control of the firmware. That's why WisGateOS starts with version 1.x.x.

| Daily Build No. / Bug No. | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -                         | Fixed an issue where sometimes the cellular connection could not be established after a reboot. Addressed the channel autoselect option.                        |
| -                         | Resolved the problem with FineTimestampType uplink to ChirpStack value being set to NONE.                                                                       |
| -                         | Fixed the Frame Buffer Backup (Automatic data recovery) to TTN in Packet Forwarder mode. Packet timestamps are now correctly recovered.                         |
| -                         | Addressed a scenario where downlinks were rejected by the forwarder.                                                                                            |
| -                         | Fixed an issue where the Build-In NS would fall into a loop when the MQTT client TLS version did not match the MQTT broker.                                     |
| -                         | Using the AWS IoT MQTT client to subscribe to 64 bytes of uplink data will now receive the data properly after 1 minute.                                        |
| -                         | Basics Station now connects to Actility NS after the gateway is rebooted.                                                                                       |
| -                         | Devices can now join the Built-In server even if the Global integration uses TLS V1.                                                                            |
| -                         | Fixed an issue with backup files in WisGateOS versions 1.3.1(b41) to 1.3.5(b135).                                                                               |
| -                         | Resolved the problem where the RSSI value of FSK channel data displayed on the RAK2287 gateway exceeded the expected range.                                     |
| -                         | Addressed the issue where RSSI levels were displayed as 2 or 0 in WisGateOS 1.3.6.                                                                              |
| -                         | Fixed the inability to select Basics Station as the work mode in RAK7289C-8Channel(USB), where USB-7289C BS was disabled.                                       |
| -                         | After inserting the SIM card and disabling the cellular function, the values for signal level and network are now updated correctly.                            |
| -                         | Reduced the default ping interval for 4G to minimize SIM data consumption.                                                                                      |
| -                         | Fixed an issue where lorasrv became abnormal after setting the SSL/TLS Mode to Self-signed server & client certification and after configuring the certificate. |
| -                         | Resolved the problem where Basics Station mode failed to obtain beacons in TTN and AWS class B modes.                                                           |
| -                         | Fixed the "Bad Gateway 502 error" that occurred when using the MQTT protocol to connect to Azure IoT Hub through PF mode.                                       |
