## Product Description

**RAK4600 Breakout Board** is specifically designed to allow easy access to the pins on the board to simplify development and testing. The breakout board form factor allows the RAK4600 stamp module form factor pinout to be transferred to 2.54&nbsp;mm headers.

The board itself has the RAK4600 at its core, integrating an **nRF52832 MCU** and an **SX1276 LoRa chip**. It has an ultra-low power consumption of 13.3&nbsp;Î¼A (down to 11.2&nbsp;Î¼A @ 2.0&nbsp;V) in sleep mode, and high LoRa output power (20&nbsp;dBm) in work mode. Its BLE output power is up to 4&nbsp;dBm.

The board complies with **LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification**. It also supports LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communication.

The RF communication capabilities of the board (LoRa + BLE) make it suitable for a variety of applications in the IoT field. Such applications are home automation, sensor networks, building automation, and personal area networks applications (health/fitness sensors and monitors).
