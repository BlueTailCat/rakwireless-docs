# WisBlock Kit 4 and RAK Edge Gateway Complete LoRaWAN Guide with TTN V3 and TagoIO

## Overview

This guide is about learning how to set up a complete LoRaWAN application from the device and gateway up to the network server.

This guide is composed of the following section:
- [Setting Up the Gateway](#setting-up-the-gateway)
- [Setting Up the Network Server](#setting-up-the-network-server)
- [Setting Up the Device](#setting-up-the-device)
- [Setting Up IoT Dashboard Using TagoIO](#setting-up-iot-dashboard-using-tagoio)

:::tip üìù NOTE:
If you are new to LoRaWAN, here are a few good references about LoRaWAN and gateways:

- [LoRaWAN 101](https://news.rakwireless.com/lorawan-r-101-all-you-need-to-know/)
- [What is a LoRaWAN Gateway?](https://news.rakwireless.com/what-is-a-lorawan-gateway/)
- [How do LoRaWAN Gateways work?](https://news.rakwireless.com/how-do-lorawan-gateways-work/)
- [Things to Consider When Picking A LoRaWAN Gateway](https://news.rakwireless.com/things-to-consider-when-picking-a-lorawan-gateway/)

LoRaWAN gateway models like WisGate Edge have built-in network servers. It is also common that the LoRaWAN network server is external or in the cloud. The popular LoRaWAN network server in the cloud that you can use for free (but offers enterprise service, too) is TTN.

:::

##### Access the Gateway

In this section, several ways of accessing the gateway are provided to have different alternatives for you to choose from depending on the availability of the requirements needed.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Do not power the device if the LoRa Antenna port has been left open to avoid potential damage to the RAK7268/RAK7268C WisGate Edge Lite 2.
:::

##### Wi-Fi AP Mode

By default, the gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode, which means that you can find an SSID named **RAK72XX_YYYY** on your PC's Wi-Fi Network List. **XX** is the code of your chosen WisGate Edge Gateway and **YYYY** is the last two bytes of the gateway's MAC address.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 No password is required to connect via Wi-Fi
:::

Using your preferred Web browser, log in with the credentials provided below:

- **Browser Address**: 192.168.230.1
- **Username**: root
- **Password**: root

##### WAN Port (Ethernet)

Connect the Ethernet cable to the port marked ETH on the gateway and the other end to the PoE port of the PoE injector. Connect the LAN port of the PoE injector to your PC.

The default IP is **169.254.X.X.** The last two segments (X.X) are mapped from the last four bits of the MAC address of your gateway.

For example, the last four bits of the MAC address are 0F:01, and the IP address is 169.254.15.1. Make sure to manually set the address of your PC to one in the same network (for example 169.254.15.100). Use the same credentials for the Web UI as for AP mode.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1906/quickstart/wisblock-sensor-silkscreen.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="RAK1906 connection to WisBlock Base"
/>

###### Disassembling

The procedure for disassembling any type of WisBlock module is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1906/quickstart/removing-screws.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1906/quickstart/detaching-silkscreen.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module"

:::tip üìù NOTE
Detailed information about the RAK4631 BLE and LoRa antenna can be found on the [antenna datasheet](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/#LoRa/WisBlock/Accessories/).
:::

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
When using the LoRa or Bluetooth Low Energy transceivers, make sure that an antenna is always connected. Using these transceivers without an antenna can damage the system. Make sure to fix the module with the screws to ensure a proper function.
:::

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming the RAK1906.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- Battery can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the RAK WisBlock Base Board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
:::

#### Software Setup

The RAK1906 is a 4-in-1 Environmental Sensor board that contains the Bosch BME680 chip. It is specially designed for wearables where size and low power consumption are critical requirements. The BME680 contains a small Metal-Oxide (MOX) sensor and an I2C interface used to communicate with WisBlock Core.

The RAK1906 module gives information about:
- Air pressure
- Air quality
- Ambient Air Temperature
- Environment Humidity

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
The BME680 requires a burn-in period to collect accurate readings. The burn-in procedure can be achieved by reading all sensors once every 5 seconds for at least 20 minutes the first time that you use it. For each subsequent use, the readings should stabilize 2-3 minutes after power-up.
:::

##### Software Configuration

1. Download the (Arduino IDE)[https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), then install it on your PC or laptop.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
_**If you are using Windows 10**_.
Do _**NOT**_ install the Arduino IDE from the Microsoft App Store. Install the original Arduino IDE from the Arduino official website! The Arduino app from the Microsoft App Store has problems using third-party Board Support Packages.

##### Configuring LoRaWAN

Before uploading the Arduino Code, there are configurations that you need to set up to ensure that the device can join a LoRaWAN Network server.

The steps below will explain the default settings and how to configure them.

1. Set up the LoRa Region.

Default region is **EU868**.

```c
LoRaMacRegion_t g_CurrentRegion = LORAMAC_REGION_EU868;
```

You can change this to a region that is applicable to you like `LORAMAC_REGION_US915`, `LORAMAC_REGION_AU915`, etc.

2. Set up the LoRaWAN activation method.

Default is **OTAA**.

```c
bool doOTAA = true;
```

To configure the device to ABP, you need to make this boolean variable `false`.

3. Set up the message type if confirmed or not.

Default is **confirmed message**.

```c
lmh_confirm g_CurrentConfirm = LMH_CONFIRMED_MSG;
```

You can change to an unconfirmed message by changing the value to `LMH_UNCONFIRMED_MSG`.

4. Set up device class.

Default is **Class A**.

```c
DeviceClass_t g_CurrentClass = CLASS_A;
```

You can change this to **CLASS_B** (still under development) or **CLASS_C**.

5. Setup the EUIs and KEY. Get these parameters from the [Connecting RAK4631 to TTN V3 Application](/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK-Edge-Gateway-Kit-4-TagoIO-Guide/#connecting-rak4631-to-ttn-v3-application) section of this guide. It is very important that the EUI and KEY will match the one configured in the TTN application. Otherwise, your device will not be able to connect to the TTN server. In this application, the device is activated via OTAA so you need to configure the Device EUI, Application EUI, and Application Key.

```c
uint8_t nodeDeviceEUI[8] = {0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x33, 0x33};
uint8_t nodeAppEUI[8] = {0xB8, 0x27, 0xEB, 0xFF, 0xFE, 0x39, 0x00, 0x00};
uint8_t nodeAppKey[16] = {0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88};
```

6. Set up uplink period.

The default is **20000&nbsp;mS**.

```c
#define LORAWAN_APP_INTERVAL 20000
```


##### LoRaWAN Payload

- This is the setup on the `void send_lora_frame(void)` function.

```c
if (lmh_join_status_get() != LMH_SET)
{
  //Not joined, try again later
  return;
}
if (!bme.performReading()) {
  return;
}
bme680_get();

lmh_error_status error = lmh_send(&m_lora_app_data, g_CurrentConfirm);
if (error == LMH_SUCCESS)
{
  count++;
  Serial.printf("lmh_send ok count %d\n", count);
}
else
{
  count_fail++;
  Serial.printf("lmh_send fail count %d\n", count_fail);
}
```

- This is the setup on the `void bme680_get()` function. This will gather the data from the sensor and package them in a LoRaWAN payload.

```c
char oled_data[32] = {0};
Serial.print("result: ");
uint32_t i = 0;
memset(m_lora_app_data.buffer, 0, LORAWAN_APP_DATA_BUFF_SIZE);
m_lora_app_data.port = gAppPort;

double temp = bme.temperature;
double pres = bme.pressure / 100.0;
double hum = bme.humidity;
uint32_t gas = bme.gas_resistance;

data = "Tem:" + String(temp) + "C " + "Hum:" + String(hum) + "% " + "Pres:" + String(pres) + "KPa " + "Gas:" + String(gas) + "Ohms";
Serial.println(data);

// display bme680 sensor data on OLED
u8g2.clearBuffer();         // clear the internal memory
u8g2.setFont(u8g2_font_ncenB10_tr); // choose a suitable font

memset(oled_data, 0, sizeof(oled_data));
sprintf(oled_data, "T=%.2fC", temp);
u8g2.drawStr(3, 15, oled_data);

memset(oled_data, 0, sizeof(oled_data));
snprintf(oled_data, 64, "RH=%.2f%%", hum);
u8g2.drawStr(3, 30, oled_data);

memset(oled_data, 0, sizeof(oled_data));
sprintf(oled_data, "P=%.2fhPa", pres);
u8g2.drawStr(3, 45, oled_data);

memset(oled_data, 0, sizeof(oled_data));
sprintf(oled_data, "G=%dOhms", gas);
u8g2.drawStr(3, 60, oled_data);

u8g2.sendBuffer(); // transfer internal memory to the display

uint16_t t = temp * 100;
uint16_t h = hum * 100;
uint32_t pre = pres * 100;

//result: T=28.25C, RH=50.00%, P=958.57hPa, G=100406 Ohms
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = 0x01;
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)(t >> 8);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)t;
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)(h >> 8);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)h;
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((pre & 0xFF000000) >> 24);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((pre & 0x00FF0000) >> 16);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((pre & 0x0000FF00) >> 8);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)(pre & 0x000000FF);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((gas & 0xFF000000) >> 24);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((gas & 0x00FF0000) >> 16);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((gas & 0x0000FF00) >> 8);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)(gas & 0x000000FF);
m_lora_app_data.buffsize = i;
```


##### Data Format


| Byte1 | Byte2        | Byte3        | Byte4     | Byte5     |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------ | --------- | --------- |
| 1     | Temperature1 | Temperature2 | Humidity1 | Humidity2 |


| Byte6       | Byte7       | Byte8       | Byte9       | Byte10 | Byte11 | Byte12 | Byte13 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Barometric1 | Barometric2 | Barometric3 | Barometric4 | Gas1   | Gas2   | Gas3   | Gas4   |



  - Byte1 is a marker for the data type, here always 1.
  - Every byte value is MSB first.
  - Temperature is sent as two bytes, enlarged 100 times for accuracy. For example, 2510 means 25.01 C, sent as 0x09 0xCE.
  - Humidity is sent as two bytes, enlarged 100 times for accuracy. For example, 4173 means 41.73%, sent as 0x10 0x4D.
  - Barometric pressure is sent as four bytes, enlarged 100 times for accuracy. For example, 100945 means 1009.45&nbsp;hPa, sent as 0x00 0x01 0x8A 0x51.
  - Gas resistance is sent as four bytes. For example, 63560&nbsp;Ohm, sent as 0x00 0x00 0xF8 0x48.


##### Uploading the Arduino Code

After a successful installation of the library and configuration of the LoRaWan Network Server setup, you can now select the right serial port and upload the code, as shown in **Figure 49** and **Figure 50**.

3. Copy this Decoder code and paste it inside the Formatter code. Then click **Save Changes**.

```js
// WisBlock Enviromental Data Frame Example: 0x0109CE104D00018A510000F848

function Decoder(bytes, port) {
    // Decode an uplink message from a buffer
    // (array) of bytes to an object of fields.
    var decoded = {};
    // Check which data we received
    if (bytes[0] == 1) {
        // Received data is Environment Monitoring data
        decoded.temperature = (bytes[1] << 8 | (bytes[2])) / 100;
        decoded.humidity = (bytes[3] << 8 | (bytes[4])) / 100;
        decoded.pressure = (bytes[8] | (bytes[7] << 8) | (bytes[6] << 16) | (bytes[5] << 24)) / 100;
        decoded.gas = bytes[12] | (bytes[11] << 8) | (bytes[10] << 16) | (bytes[9] << 24);
    } else if (bytes[0] == 7) {
// add more sensor data formats here
//        } else if (bytes.[0] == xx) {
    }
    return decoded;
}
```

### Setting Up IoT Dashboard Using TagoIO

This section will guide you on how to integrate your application using TagoIO.

1. Go to [Tago.io](https://tago.io/) and create your account.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/rak-developer-kit/kit-4/wisblock-kit4-tagoio/img6.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Signup TagoIO account"
/>

2. Login into your TagoIO account. If this is your first device to connect between TTN V3 and TagoIO, then you will need to create a [Service Authorization](https://admin.tago.io/devices/authorization). You will need to copy the authorization that you created for TTN V3 later.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
- You need to create **ONLY** one Authorization for all of your devices.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/rak-developer-kit/kit-4/wisblock-kit4-tagoio/img7.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Service Authorization"
/>

3. When you're already on the [Service Authorization](https://admin.tago.io/devices/authorization) page, enter a name for this authorization then click **Generate**. After that, you can now see your newly created authorization.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/rak-developer-kit/kit-4/wisblock-kit4-tagoio/img8.png"

  width="100%"
  caption="Created Webhook"
/>

8. Now, on your TagoIO account, you just need to start adding your device. Go to **Devices**, and under **Networks**, click the **LoRaWAN TTI/TTN v3**, then choose **Custom TTI/TTN**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/rak-developer-kit/kit-4/wisblock-kit4-tagoio/img16.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Network Selection for your Device"
/>

9. To connect the device to TagoIO, the following parameters must be set:
  - **Device Name** ‚Äì Give a name for your device.
  - **Device EUI** ‚Äì This will be your `DevEUI` key that you have on **The Things Stack**. To find your Device EUI, go to **Applications** > ` <name of your application> ` > **End devices** > ` <name of your device> `. Then under **Activation information**, you will see your `DevEUI`.

  then, click **Create my Device**.

<rk-img
