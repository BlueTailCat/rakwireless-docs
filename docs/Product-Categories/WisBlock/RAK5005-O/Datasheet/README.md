# RAK5005-O WisBlock Base Board Datasheet

## WisBlock Overview

**RAK5005-O WisBlock Base** module is the main board that allows you to attach **WisBlock modules** through the standardized expansion connectors. In addition, the **WisBlock Base** module also comprises a USB port, indicator LEDs, buttons, and extended IO interfaces.

**WisBlock modules** are flexible building blocks built by RAKWireless for the IoT industry. **WisBlock modules** support dozens of types of CPUs, sensors, and interface circuit boards. This concept allows you to build your own electronic solutions very quickly, using building blocks to materialize your new ideas. Also, through high-speed connectors and easily attachable interconnections, you will be able to build reliable industrial products.

If you can't find a module that fits your IoT requirements, use the standard connectors of WisBlock to develop your own specific function module. WisBlock supports open-source hardware architecture and you can find tutorials showing how to create your own [Awesome WisBlock](https://github.com/RAKWireless/Awesome-WisBlock) module.

WisBlock modules are not only for the rapid implementation of engineering prototypes but are also designed for massive production-ready applications. The modules can be used together with RAK industrial protective housing to create products ready for industrial environments. Under the unified management of WisDM, a complete end-to-end IoT solution is formed by aggregating data of wireless nodes through the RAK industrial gateways.

## Specifications

### Overview

There are six (6) slots on RAK5005-O WisBlock Base. The **CPU SLOT** is reserved for the WisBLock Core module, which has the main MCU. The **IO SLOT** is used for IO extension, for example, RS485 module, 4-20&nbsp;mA/0-5&nbsp;V module, Wireless modules. **SLOT A**, **SLOT B**, **SLOT C**, and **SLOT D** are used to connect with the I2C module, while **SLOT A** can be used for the GPS board too. Also, there are **2.54&nbsp;mm pitch connectors** for [extension interface](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK5005-O/Datasheet/#j10-j11-j12-headers/), such as **I2C**, **UART**, and **GPIO pins**.

  width="60%"
  caption="RAK5005-O Top and Bottom View"
/>

For convenience, there is a USB connector for debugging. It is connected directly to the MCU‚Äôs USB port (if supported). You can access the internal MCU by connecting to a computer‚Äôs USB port directly. This USB connector is also used as a battery charging port.

Each module has a method designed to connect and fasten the module easily. These connectors are **high-speed board-to-board connectors**, they provide signal integrity for each data bus. A set of screws are used for attaching the module under the environment with vibrations.

To avoid electromagnetic interference and heating interference, the sensor connectors on the WisBlock Base are designed to be installed on both sides of the PCB. Also, a sensor module can be attached either on the top layer or the bottom layer of the WisBlock Base board.

For example, it is recommended to attach a temperature sensor outside of the base board, as shown in **Figure 6**. It allows getting more accurate measurements since the the heating introduced by other modules could interfere with the temperature sensor located on the top layer of the base board.

:::tip üìù NOTE
There are four connectors reserved for the sensor modules on the RAK5005-O: **connector A, B, C**, and **D**. The pin definition of **connector A** is different from the definition of the **connector B-D**.
:::

The pinout definition of the WisBlock Modules with 24-pin connector on WisBlock Base varies according to its connector, **from A to D**.
