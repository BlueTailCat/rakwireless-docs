- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core?utm_source=WisBlockCore&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
- USB Cable
- [Li-Ion/LiPo Battery (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/battery-connector-cable?utm_source=BatteryConnector&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
- [Solar Charger (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/solar-panel-connector-cable?utm_source=SolarPanelConnector&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)

#### Software

- Download and install [Arduino IDE.](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards to your Arduino Boards Manager, install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP.](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index)

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

WisBlock can integrate this module, which makes it easy to build up an ambient light data acquisition system.

For more information about RAK12008, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

RAK12008 module can be connected to any sensor slots of [WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) to communicate with the WisBlock Core, as shown in **Figure 1**. It will work on **SLOT A to F**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 2**, the locations for Slots A to F are properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [WisBlock Base board assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws, depending on the module.

  width="50%"
  caption="RAK12008 connection to WisBlock Base"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure for disassembling any type of WisBlock module is the same.

1. To begin disassembling, remove the screws.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak12008/quickstart/removing-screws.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. After removing the screws, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

3. Detach the module from the base board by applying forcer to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 5**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
- If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/). This tool finds possible pin conflicts.
- RAK12008 uses I2C communication lines, which can cause possible conflict, especially on some IO modules.
:::

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and, eventually, other electronic parts.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the WisBlock Base board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.

### Software Configuration and Example

#### Initial Test of the RAK12008 WisBlock Module

1. Install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index) for WisBlock by using the `package_rakwireless_index.json` board installation package. The WisBlock Core should now be available on the Arduino IDE.

2. After that, you need to select the WisBlock Core you have, as shown in **Figure 6** to **Figure 8**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you experience any error in compiling the example sketch, check the updated code for your WisBlock Core Module. You can find it on the [RAK12008 WisBlock Example Code Repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/common/sensors/RAK12008). The sample code on GitHub will work on all WisBlock Core.
:::

4. Once the example code is open, install the [SparkFun STC3x](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_STC3x_Arduino_Library/tree/main) library. Click the highlighted link, as shown in **Figure 9** and **Figure 10**.

5. After successful installation of the library, you can now select the right serial port and upload the code, as shown in **Figure 11** and **Figure 12**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you're using the RAK11200 as your WisBlock Core, the RAK11200 requires the **Boot0** pin to be configured properly first before uploading. If not done properly, uploading the source code to RAK11200 will fail. Check the full details on the [RAK11200 Quick Start Guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK11200/Quickstart/#uploading-to-wisblock).

6. When you have successfully uploaded the example sketch, open the serial monitor of the Arduino IDE to see the sensor's reading logs. If you see the logs, as shown in **Figure 13**, then your RAK12008 is properly communicating to the WisBlock core. In this example code, you will see CO2 concentration and temperature readings.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
RAK12008 is developed for high-concentration CO2 applications and not for common ambient air.
