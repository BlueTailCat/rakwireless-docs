## Product Configuration

### Interfacing with RAK11300

RAK11300 module can be configured using AT commands via the UART interface. You need a USB to UART TTL adapter to connect the RAK11300 to the PC's USB port and a serial terminal tool. You can use [RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/#LoRa/Tools), so you can easily send AT commands and view the replies from the console output.

You can also use the USB pins of RAK11300 to send AT commands and update the firmware via `.uf2` firmware file.

#### Connect to the RAK11300

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak11300-module/quickstart/RAK11300_connection.png"
  width="55%"
  caption="RAK11300 Module Connection"
/>

1. Connect the UART pins of RAK11300 to the USB port of a general-purpose computer using a USB to UART TTL adapter like [RAKDAP1](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/accessories/products/daplink-tool).

2. You can also establish a direct USB connection to the USB Data pins (+) and (-) of the RAK11300. However, you still need to power the RAK11300 via external 3.3&nbsp;V on the VDD lines. You cannot use VBUS of the USB port of the PC because it is still at 5V level.

3. Prepare a serial terminal software like the [RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/#LoRa/Tools).

4. Configure the serial communication tool by selecting the proper port detected by the computer and configure the link as follows:

 * Baud Rate: **115200 baud**
 * Data Bits: **8 bits**
 * Stop Bits: **1 stop bit**
 * Parity: **NONE**

#### Configuring RAK11300

The first step is to connect the RAK11300 module to the USB-UART converter computer as described in the previous section. Using a serial communication tool, you can now send commands to RAK11300. For example, sending the `AT` will display `OK`. For the details of all supported AT commands, refer to the [AT Command Manual](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK11300-Module/AT-Command-Manual/).

:::tip üìù NOTE

You can also send AT command via the USB pins of RAK11300.

  width="95%"
  caption="RAK11300 EVB in the context of the TTN"
/>

As shown in **Figure 2**, The Things Stack (TTN V3) is an open-source LoRaWAN Network Server suitable for global, geo-distributed public and private deployments, as well as for small, local networks. The architecture follows the LoRaWAN Network Reference Model for standards compliancy and interoperability. This project is actively maintained by [The Things Industries](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/).

LoRaWAN is a protocol for low-power wide-area networks. It allows for large-scale Internet of Things deployments where low-powered devices efficiently communicate with Internet-connected applications over long-range wireless connections.

The RAK11300 WisDuo module can be part of this ecosystem as a device, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple it is to send data to The Things Stack using the LoRaWAN protocol. To achieve this, the RAK11300 WisDuo module must be located inside the coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway connected to The Things Stack server.

#### Registration to TTN and Creating LoRaWAN Applications

1. The first step is to go to [The Things Network platform](https://console.cloud.thethings.network/) and select a cluster, as shown in **Figure 3**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak11300-module/quickstart/image_1.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Selecting Cluster in TTN V3"
/>

You can use the same login credentials on the TTN V2 if you have one. If you have no account yet, you need to create one.

2. To register as a new user to TTN, click on **Login with The Things ID**, then select **Register** on the next page, as shown in **Figure 4** and **Figure 5**.

If there is no error on the previous step, you should now be on the application console page. The next step is to add end-devices to your TTN application. LoRaWAN specification enforces that each end-device has to be personalized and activated. There are two options for registering devices depending on the activation mode selected. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or Activation-By-Personalization (ABP).

#### TTN OTAA Device Registration

1. Go to your application console to be able to register a device. To start adding an OTAA end-device, you need to click **+ Add end device**, as shown in **Figure 10**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak11300-module/quickstart/image_8.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Add end device"
/>

2. To register the module, you need to click first **Manually** then configure the **Frequency Plan**, **LoRaWAN Version**, and **Regional Parameter version**, as shown in **Figure 11** and **Figure 12**. By default, TTN V3 will be setting your device via OTAA mode.

  width="65%"
  caption="Device configuration"
/>

3. Then input the OTAA joining parameters **DevEUI**, **AppEUI**, and **AppKey**. You can click generate button on the side of the parameters **DevEUI** and **AppKey** to generate unique combinations. If your device has **DevEUI** on its label or sticker, you must use it to make sure your device uniqueness. The **AppKey** needs to be generated. **AppKey** can be left as all zero or with a specific hexadecimal value. Also, you can add a more descriptive **End device ID** for your device.

:::tip üìù NOTE

It is advisable to use a meaningful **End device ID** that will match your device purpose. The End device ID `rak-device-test` is for illustration purposes only.

:::

4. After putting all the details, click **Register end device** to end your device registration, as shown in **Figure 13**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak11300-module/quickstart/image_11.png"
  width="65%"
  caption="OTAA Device Registration"
/>

5. You should now be able to see the device on the TTN console after you fully register your device, as shown in **Figure 14**.

:::tip üìù NOTE

The **AppEUI**, **DevEUI**, and **AppKey** are the parameters that you will need to activate your LoRaWAN end-device via OTAA. The **AppKey** is hidden by default for security reasons, but you can easily show it by clicking the show button. You can also copy the parameters quickly using the copy button.

The three OTAA parameters on the TTN device console are MSB by default.

These parameters are always accessible on the device console page, as shown in **Figure 14**.

#### OTAA Configuration for TTN

The RAK11300 module supports a series of AT commands to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module.

1. To set up the RAK11300 module to join the TTN using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK11300 module to your computer and open the Serial terminal like the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the correct COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify that the current configuration is working by sending a simple `AT` command:

```
AT

OK
```

You will receive `OK` when you input the `AT` command.

:::tip üìù NOTE

If do not receive an `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured. Also, you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from a USB port, make sure that you have a good USB cable.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak11300-module/quickstart/at_ok.png"
  width="55%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>

2. The next step is to configure the OTAA LoRaWAN parameters in RAK11300:

- LoRaWAN join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRaWAN class: **Class A**
- LoRaWAN region: **EU868**

Set the LoRaWAN activation to OTAA.

```
AT+NJM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN class to Class A.

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

Set the frequency/region to EU868.

```
AT+BAND=5
```

:::tip üìù NOTE

Depending on the Regional Band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK11300 to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is especially important on Regional Bands like US915, AU915, and CN470.

To configure the masking of channels for the sub-bands, you can use the `AT+MASK` command that can be found on the [AT Command Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK11300-Module/AT-Command-Manual/#atmask).

To illustrate, you can use sub-band 2 by sending the command `AT+MASK=2`.

**List of band parameter options**

| Code | Regional Band |
| :--: | :-----------: |
| 0    | AS923-1       |
| 1    | AU915         |
| 2    | CN470         |
| 3    | CN779         |

| 8    | US915         |
| 9    | AS923-2       |
| 10   | AS923-3       |
| 11   | AS923-4       |
| 12   | RU864         |

3. After the configuration of the LoRaWAN parameters, the next step is to set up the EUIs and key. You need to use the values from the TTN console you configured in the earlier steps.


- Device EUI: **70B3D57ED0046DBD**
- Application EUI: **0000000000000000**
- Application Key: **FB55B2F3409A5E2AF3442AC2E99BBD14**

Set the Device EUI.

```
AT+DEVEUI=70B3D57ED0046DBD
```

Set the Application EUI.

```
AT+APPEUI=0000000000000000
```

Set the Application Key.

```
AT+APPKEY=FB55B2F3409A5E2AF3442AC2E99BBD14
```

  width="55%"
  caption="Configuring LoRa Parameters"
/>

3. After EUI and keys configuration, you need to restart the device for the changes to take effect. You can do this by inputting the `ATZ` command or pushing the reset button. The Serial port connection is lost after the `ATZ` command or pushing the reset button. The connection must be re-established on the connected computer before log output can be seen or AT commands can be entered again. You must be able to see the summary of configurations when you reconnect your device.

/>

4. After checking if the parameters are properly set, you can now join the network and send the payload.

```
AT+JOIN=1:1:10:8
```

Join command format: **`AT+JOIN=w:x:y:z`**

| Parameter | Description                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| w         | Join command - 1: joining, 0: stop joining.                                    |
| x         | Auto-join config - 1: auto-join on power up, 0: no auto-join                   |
| y         | Reattempt interval in seconds (7-255) - **This is currently fixed to 30 sec**. |
| z         | Number of join attempts (0-255) - 0 is default.                                |

After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request is successfully received by a LoRa gateway, then you should see the `AT+JOIN=SUCCESS` status reply, as shown in **Figure 20**.

:::tip üìù NOTE

If the OTAA device join failed, you need to check if your device is within reach of a working LoRaWAN gateway that is configured to connect to TTN. It is also important to check that all your OTAA parameters (DEVEUI, APPEUI, and APPKEY) are correct by using `AT+DEVEUI=?`, `AT+APPEUI=?`, and `AT+APPKEY=?` commands. Lastly, make sure that the antenna of your device is properly connected.

After checking all the things above, try to join again.
:::

5. With the end-device properly activated, you can now try to send some payload after successful join.

```
AT+SEND=2:1234
```

6. Send command format: **`AT+SEND=<port>:<payload>`**.

/>

3. At this step, input the ABP parameters needed by the device. You need to generate the parameters by clicking the Generate button. You must have values for **Device address**, **AppSKey**, and **NwkSKey**. The DevEUI is not really needed in ABP, but you can add that, too. Check if your module has a DevEUI on the sticker or QR that you can scan. You can use this as the DevEUI.

Optionally, you can add a more descriptive **End device name** about your device.

:::tip üìù NOTE

It is advisable to use a meaningful **End device ID** that will match and describe your device purpose. The End device ID `rak-abp-test` is for illustration purposes only.

4. After the Device address and sessions keys configuration, you need to restart the device for the changes to take effect. You can do this by either inputting the `ATZ` command or pushing the reset button. The Serial port connection is lost after the ATZ command or pushing the reset button. The connection must be re-established on the connected computer before log output can be seen or AT commands can be entered again. You must be able to see the summary of configurations when you reconnect your device.

5. After checking if the parameters are properly set, you can now join the network and send the payload.

```
AT+JOIN=1:1:10:8
```

Join command format: **`AT+JOIN=w:x:y:z`**
| Parameter | Description                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| w         | Join command - 1: joining, 0: stop joining.                                    |
| x         | Auto-join config - 1: auto-join on power up, 0: no auto-join                   |
| y         | Reattempt interval in seconds (7-255) - **This is currently fixed to 30 sec**. |
| z         | Number of join attempts (0-255) - 0 is default.                                |

6. With the end-device properly activated, you can now try to send some payload after successful join. In ABP, there will be no `AT+JOIN=SUCCESS` reply on the join command.

```
AT+SEND=2:1234
```

7. Send command format: **`AT+SEND=<port>:<payload>`**.

:::tip üìù NOTE

If your LoRaWAN payload didn't reach the TTN, check if your device is within reach of a working LoRaWAN gateway that is configured to connect to TTN. It is also important to check that all your ABP parameters (DEVADDR, APPSKEY, and NWKSKEY) are correct by using `AT+DEVADDR=?`, `AT+APPSKEY=?`, and `AT+NWKSKEY=?` commands. Lastly, make sure that the antenna of your device is properly connected.

After checking all the things above, try to send LoRaWAN payloads again.

### Connecting with ChirpStack

In this section, it shows how to connect the RAK11300 module to the ChirpStack platform.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak11300-module/quickstart/23.chirpstack-platform.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="RAK11300 Module in the Context of the ChirpStack Platform"
/>

The ChirpStack, previously known as the LoRaServer project, provides open-source components for building LoRaWAN networks. Like the case of the TTN, the RAK11300 module is located in the periphery and will transmit the data to the backend servers through a LoRa gateway. Learn more about [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/).

:::tip üìù NOTE

It is assumed that you are using RAK Gateway and its built-in ChirpStack. Also, the gateway with the ChirpStack must be configured successfully. For further information, check the RAK documents for more details.

:::

* In summary, these are the requirements:

  1. Have a ChirpStack online gateway. The frequency band of the nodes should be consistent with the frequency band of the gateway in use.
      * [Connect the Gateway with Chirpstack](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7243/Quickstart/#connect-the-gateway-with-chirpstack)
  2.  The RAK Serial Port Tool provided by RAK
  3.  RAK11300 module

:::tip üìù NOTE
The frequency band used in the demonstration is EU868. Use a high-frequency version of RAK11300. The product number should be **RAK11300**.
:::

#### Create a New Application

1. Login to the ChirpStack server using your account and password.

2. Go to the Application section, as shown in **Figure 35**.

7. Once the node is created, fill in the necessary data. You can generate a Device EUI automatically by clicking the following icon, or you can write a correct Device EUI in the edit box.

Fill in the parameters requested:

* **Device name and Device description**: These are descriptive texts about your device.

* **Device EUI**: This interface allows you to generate a Device EUI automatically by clicking the generate icon. You can also add a specific Device EUI directly in the form.

* **Device Profile**:
  * If you want to join in OTAA mode, select **DeviceProfile_OTAA**.
  * If you want to join in ABP mode, select **DeviceProfile_ABP**.

:::tip üìù NOTE
Device profiles **DeviceProfile_OTAA** and **DeviceProfile_ABP** are only available if you are using the built-in Chirpstack LoRaWAN Server of RAK Gateways.

If you have your own Chirpstack installation, you can set up the device profile with `LoRaWAN MAC version 1.0.3` and `LoRaWAN Regional Parameters revision B` to make it compatible with RAK11300.

4. To end the process, it is a good practice to review that the Application Key is properly associated with this device. The Application Key can be verified in the **KEYS(OTAA)** tab, as shown in **Figure 46**.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak11300-module/quickstart/35.application-key.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Key Associated with the New Device"

:::tip üìù NOTE

Standard OTAA mode requires the **Device EUI**, **Application Key**, and **Application EUI**, but in the ChirpStack‚Äôs implementation, only the Device EUI and the Application Key are mandatory. The Application EUI is not required and not recorded in the Application tab. Nevertheless, you can reuse the Device EUI as the Application EUI during the configuration on the side of the node.

:::

#### OTAA Configuration for Chirpstack

The RAK11300 module supports a series of AT commands to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module.

1. To set up the RAK11300 module to join the Chirpstack using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK11300 module to your computer and open the Serial terminal like the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the correct COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify that the current configuration is working by sending a simple `AT` command:

```
AT

OK
```

You will receive `OK` when you input the `AT` command.

:::tip üìù NOTE

If do not receive an `OK` or any reply, you need to check if the wiring of your UART lines is correct and if the baud is correctly configured. Also, you can check if the device is powered correctly. If you are getting power from a USB port, make sure that you have a good USB cable.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak11300-module/quickstart/at_ok.png"
  width="55%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>

2. The next step is to configure the OTAA LoRaWAN parameters in RAK11300:

- LoRaWAN join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRaWAN class: **Class A**
- LoRaWAN region: **EU868**

Set the LoRaWAN activation to OTAA.

```
AT+NJM=1
```

Set the LoRaWAN class to Class A.

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

Set the frequency/region to EU868.

```
AT+BAND=5
```

:::tip üìù NOTE

Depending on the Regional Band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK11300 to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is especially important on Regional Bands like US915, AU915, and CN470.

To configure the masking of channels for the sub-bands, you can use the `AT+MASK` command that can be found on the [AT Command Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK11300-Module/AT-Command-Manual/#atmask).

To illustrate, you can use sub-band 2 by sending the command `AT+MASK=2`.

**List of band parameter options**

| Code | Regional Band |
| :--: | :-----------: |
| 0    | AS923-1       |
| 1    | AU915         |
| 2    | CN470         |
| 3    | CN779         |

| 11   | AS923-4       |
| 12   | RU864         |

3. After the configuration of the LoRaWAN parameters, the next step is to set up the EUIs and key. You need the use the values from the Chirpstack console you configured in the earlier steps.

- Device EUI: **5E9D1E0857CF25F1**
- Application EUI: **5E9D1E0857CF25F1**
- Application Key: **F921D50CD7D02EE3C5E6142154F274B2**

:::tip üìù NOTE
The Application EUI parameter is not required in the ChirpStack platform; therefore, it is possible to use the same id as the Device EUI.
:::

Set the Device EUI.

```
AT+DEVEUI=5E9D1E0857CF25F1
```

Set the Application EUI.

```
AT+APPEUI=5E9D1E0857CF25F1
```

Set the Application Key.

```
AT+APPKEY=F921D50CD7D02EE3C5E6142154F274B2
```

4. After EUI and keys configuration, you need to restart the device for the changes to take effect. You can do this by inputting the `ATZ` command or pushing the reset button. The Serial port connection is lost after the ATZ command or pushing the reset button. The connection must be re-established on the connected computer before log output can be seen or AT commands can be entered again. You must be able to see the summary of configurations when you reconnect your device.

5. After checking if the parameters are properly set, you can now join the network and send the payload.

```
AT+JOIN=1:1:10:8
```

Join command format: **`AT+JOIN=w:x:y:z`**

| Parameter | Description                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| w         | Join command - 1: joining, 0: stop joining.                                    |
| x         | Auto-join config - 1: auto-join on power up, 0: no auto-join                   |
| y         | Reattempt interval in seconds (7-255) - **This is currently fixed to 30 sec**. |
| z         | Number of join attempts (0-255) - 0 is default.                                |

After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request is successfully received by a LoRa gateway, then you should see the `AT+JOIN=SUCCESS` status reply, as shown in **Figure 20**.

:::tip üìù NOTE

If the OTAA device join failed, you need to check if your device is within reach of a working LoRaWAN gateway that is configured to connect to TTN. It is also important to check that all your OTAA parameters (DEVEUI, APPEUI, and APPKEY) are correct by using `AT+DEVEUI=?`, `AT+APPEUI=?`, and `AT+APPKEY=?` commands. Lastly, make sure that the antenna of your device is properly connected.

After checking all the things above, try to join again.
:::

6. With the end-device properly activated, you can now try to send some payload after successful join.

```
AT+SEND=2:1234
```

7. Send command format: **`AT+SEND=<port>:<payload>`**.

<rk-img

  width="55%"
  caption="OTAA Joining and Sample payload"
/>

8. On the ChirpStack platform, you should see the join and uplink messages in the LORAWAN FRAMES tab, as shown in **Figure 51**. By convention, messages sent from nodes to gateways are considered as **Uplinks**, while messages sent by gateways to nodes are considered as **Downlinks**.

#### Chirpstack ABP Device Registration

1. During the registration of a new device, if you select **DeviceProfile_ABP**, as shown in **Figure 52**, then the ChirpStack platform will assume that this device will join the LoRaWAN network using the ABP mode.


:::tip üìù NOTE

Check the **Disable counting frame verification**. During the test, when the module is restarted, the frame counting number will be also be restarted from zero. This would cause a synchronization problem with the ChirpStack server treating it as a replay attack. For the testing purpose, it is safe to disable this feature, but remember to activate it in a production environment.

2. After selecting the ABP mode, the following parameters appear in the Activation tab. Then, you can see that there are some parameters for ABP in the **ACTIVATION** item:

  * **Device address**
  * **Network Session Key**
  * **Application Session Key**

3. The parameters can be generated as random numbers by the platform or can be set with user values. Once these parameters are filled in properly, the process is completed by clicking on the **ACTIVATE DEVICE** button.


#### ABP Configuration for Chirpstack

1. To set up the RAK11300 module to join the Chirpstack using ABP, start by connecting the RAK11300 module to the computer and configure it using a Serial terminal software like the RAK Serial Port Tool. Select the correct COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.

It is recommended to start by testing the serial communication and verify the current configuration is working by sending the AT command:

```
AT
```

:::tip üìù NOTE

2. The next step is to configure the ABP LoRaWAN parameters in RAK11300:

- LoRaWAN join mode: **ABP**
- LoRaWAN class: **Class A**
- LoRaWAN region: **EU868**

Set the LoRaWAN activation to ABP.

```
AT+NJM=0
```

Set the LoRaWAN class to Class A.

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

Set the frequency/region to EU868.

```
AT+BAND=5
```

:::tip üìù NOTE

Depending on the Regional Band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK11300 to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is especially important on Regional Bands like US915, AU915, and CN470.

To configure the masking of channels for the sub-bands, you can use the `AT+MASK` command that can be found on the [AT Command Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK11300-Module/AT-Command-Manual/#atmask).

| Hardware/Software | Requirement                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Computer          | A Windows/Ubuntu/Mac computer                 |

| Firmware File     | **.uf2 firmware** file downloaded from the website |

##### Firmware Upgrade Procedure

Execute the following procedure to upgrade the firmware via USB using the `.uf2` firmware file.
1.  Download the latest application firmware of the RAK11300.
    - [RAK11300 Firmware](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK11300-Module/Datasheet/#firmware-os)

2.  Connect the RAK11300 module to the computer via USB. If your main board has no USB connection, you won't be able to upload the `.uf2` firmware file.

3.  Activate RAK11300 USB bootloader mode. There are two possible ways to do this.

- Reset the module twice by momentarily shorting the reset pin to the ground.
- Hold the BootSel button in the RAK11300 module, reset the module (short the reset pin to ground for at least 2 seconds), then wait for the USB Mass Storage `RPI-RP2` before releasing the BootSel button.

You need to do either of the two options until the USB Mass Storage `RPI-RP2` shows on your computer.

4.  Copy the **firmware.uf2** file to the `RPI-RP2` Mass Storage device.
