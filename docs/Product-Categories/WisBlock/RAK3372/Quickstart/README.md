https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index/main/package_rakwireless.com_rui_index.json
```
After that, you can then add **RAKwireless RUI STM32 Boards** via Arduino board manager.


## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

Your **RAK3372** will not work on its own. It needs at least to be connected to a WisBlock Base together with an antenna. You can then interface various WisBlock Modules via the available slots in the WisBlock Base. You can also add a battery as a power source and optional solar charging. All hardware-related configurations for your RAK3372 are discussed here.

This section covers:

- [RAK3372 Connection to Base Board](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK3372/Quickstart/#rak3372-to-wisblock-base)
- [Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK3372/Quickstart/#assembling-and-disassembling-of-wisblock-modules)
- [Antenna and Battery/Solar Connection](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK3372/Quickstart/#battery-and-solar-connection)

#### RAK3372 to WisBlock Base

The RAK3372 will not work without a WisBlock Base board. The WisBlock Base provides a USB connection for programming the RAK3372. It also provides a power source and various interfaces to RAK3372 so that it can be connected to other [WisBlock Modules](https://store.rakwireless.com/pages/wisblock) via different module slots.

RAKwireless offers many [WisBlock Base Boards](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) compatible with WisBlock Core. It is highly recommended to look at these WisBlock Base boards to see what matches your requirements in terms of available module slots, power supply options, and overall size.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- RAK3372 WB_IO3 (WisBlock IO Pin 3) is connected to PB12 of the RAK3172 module. This pin is internally connected to a 10k resistor as [mentioned on the pin definition table of the RAK3172 datasheet](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-Module/Datasheet/#pin-definition). Other WisBlock modules that use this pin will have possible conflict.
:::

To illustrate, RAK3372 can be connected to RAK19007 WisBlock Base, as shown in **Figure 1**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak3372/quickstart/rak19007-connect.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="RAK3372 connection to WisBlock Base RAK19007"
/>

Some pins are exposed on [RAK19007](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK19007/Datasheet/#interfaces), and you can easily use them via header pins. The labels are at the back, as shown in **Figure 2**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak3372/quickstart/io-pins.png"
  width="35%"
  caption="WisBlock Base exposed pins"
/>

Each WisBlock Base board has its own set of header pins available for you to use. However, these header pins are not exactly the same in each WisBlock Base. It is common to see IO pins and communication protocol pins like I2C and UART in the WisBlock Base board. More information can be found on the [official documentation of the specific WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) you used in your project.

You can access the AT command via UART2 by default (and also possible via UART1). Firmware update is only possible via UART2. A built-in USB-Serial converter is on the board to easily connect the RAK3372 to the USB port of the PC.

There are useable LEDs as well in the WisBlock Base. You can control them in your code via the `GREEN_LED` and `BLUE_RED` macro.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

**Figure 3** shows how to mount the RAK3372 module on top of a WisBlock Base board (RAK19007). Follow carefully the procedure defined in [WisBlock module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to secure the connection safely. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

##### LoRaWAN Example

This example illustrates how to program RAK3372 WisBlock Core as a stand-alone LoRaWAN end-device via [RUI3 Arduino APIs](https://docs.rakwireless.com/RUI3/Arduino-API/). To use the RAK3372 WisBlock Core module as a LoRaWAN end-device, it needs to be within reach of a working **LoRaWAN gateway** registered to a **LoRaWAN network server (LNS)** or with a built-in network server.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
If you are new to LoRaWAN, here are a few good references about LoRaWAN and gateways:

- [LoRaWAN 101](https://news.rakwireless.com/lorawan-r-101-all-you-need-to-know/)
- [What is a LoRaWAN Gateway](https://news.rakwireless.com/what-is-a-lorawan-gateway/)
- [How do LoRaWAN Gateways work?](https://news.rakwireless.com/how-do-lorawan-gateways-work/)
- [Things to Consider When Picking A LoRaWAN Gateway](https://news.rakwireless.com/things-to-consider-when-picking-a-lorawan-gateway/)

RAKwireless LoRaWAN gateway models like [WisGate Edge](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisgate-edge) have built-in network servers. It is also common that the LoRaWAN network server is external or in the cloud. The popular LoRaWAN network server in the cloud that you can use for free (but offers enterprise service, too) is [TTN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/).

To correctly run this example, it is necessary to configure the LoRaWAN parameters and create an OTAA application on your LoRaWAN gateway.

:::

###### Register the LoRaWAN Gateway on TTNv3 Community Edition

After configuring your gateway, you need to register it in TTNv3:

1. Log in to the TTNv3 Network Server with a web browser.

- [Europe](https://eu1.cloud.thethings.network/)
- [North America](https://nam1.cloud.thethings.network/)
- [Australia](https://au1.cloud.thethings.network/)

2. Navigate to the **Console** page and click on **gateway** icon, as shown in **Figure 25**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak3372/quickstart/ttnv3-initial.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="TTNv3 gateway registration and configuration"
/>

3. On **General Settings**, enter the **Gateway ID**, **Gateway EUI**, and **Gateway Name**. This information is available in your LoRaWAN gateway configuration. Select the **Gateway Server address** according to the region where the LoRaWAN gateway will be installed.

<rk-img

/>

###### Creating LoRaWAN Applications in TTN

1. The first step is to go to [The Things Network platform](https://console.cloud.thethings.network/) and select a cluster, as shown in **Figure 28**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak3372/quickstart/image_1.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Selecting Cluster in TTN V3"
/>

You can use the same login credentials on the TTN V2 if you have one. If you have no account yet, you need to create one.

2. To register as a new user to TTN, click on **Login with The Things ID** then select **register** on the next page, as shown in **Figure 29** and **Figure 30**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak3372/quickstart/image_2.png"

/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak3372/quickstart/image_3.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Registration of new account"
/>

3. You should now be on the step of creating your TTN account. Fill in all the necessary details and activate your account.

4. After creating an account, you should log in on the platform using your username/email and password then click **Submit**, as shown in **Figure 31**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak3372/quickstart/image_4.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Logging in to TTN platform"
/>

5. Click **Authorize** to proceed.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak3372/quickstart/image_5.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Authorization to TTN"
/>

6. Now that you are logged in to the platform, the next step is to create an application. Click **Create an application**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak3372/quickstart/image_6.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Creating TTN application for your LoRaWAN devices"

7. To have an application registered, you need to input first the specific details and necessary information about your application then click **Create application**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak3372/quickstart/image_7.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Details of the TTN application"
/>

8. If you had no error during the previous step, you should now be on the application console page. The next step is to add end-devices to your TTN application. LoRaWAN specification enforces that each end-device has to be personalized and activated. There are two options for registering devices depending on the activation mode you select. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or Activation-By-Personalization (ABP).  This guide will show OTAA.

###### TTN OTAA Device Registration

1. Go to your application console to be able to register a device. To start adding an OTAA end-device, click **+ Add end device**, as shown in **Figure 35**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak3372/quickstart/image_8.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Add end device"
/>

2. To register the module, click first **Manually** then configure the activation method by selecting **Over the air activation (OTAA)** and compatible **LoRaWAN version** then click the **Start** button, as shown in **Figure 36** and **Figure 37**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak3372/quickstart/image_9.png"

/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak3372/quickstart/image_10.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Device activation configuration"
/>

3. Then you need to put a unique **End device ID** and EUIs (**DevEUI** and **AppEUI**), as shown in **Figure 38**. Check if your module has a DevEUI on the sticker or QR that you can scan then use this as the device unique DevEUI.

Optionally, you can add a more descriptive **End device name** and **End device description** about your device.

4. After filling in all the details, click **Network layer settings** to proceed to the next step.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

It is advisable to use a meaningful end-device ID, end-device name, and end-device description that will match your device's purpose. The end-device ID `rak-device` is for illustration purposes only.

:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak3372/quickstart/image_11.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="OTAA Device Information"
/>

5. The next step is to set up the **Frequency plan**, a compatible **Regional Parameter version**, and the **LoRaWAN class** supported. Then you can click **Join settings**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak3372/quickstart/image_12.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="OTAA Configuration"
/>

6. The last step in the registration of a new OTAA end-device is the configuration of the **AppKey**. To get the AppKey, you must click the **generate button**. Then click **Add end device** to finish your new device registration.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak3372/quickstart/image_13.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="OTAA AppKey generation and device registration"
/>

You should now be able to see the device on the TTN console after you fully register your device, as shown in **Figure 41**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

- The **AppEUI**, **DevEUI**, and **AppKey** are the parameters that you will need to activate your LoRaWAN end-device via OTAA. The **AppKey** is hidden by default for security reasons, but you can easily show it by clicking the show button. You can also copy the parameters quickly using the copy button.
- The three OTAA parameters on the TTN device console are MSB by default.
- These parameters are always accessible on the device console page, as shown in [**Figure 50**](#firmware-upgrade-procedure).

4. In the example code, you need to modify the device EUI **OTAA_DEVEUI**, the application EUI **OTAA_APPEUI**, and the application key **OTAA_APPKEY**.

- The **OTAA_DEVEUI** parameter should match the device EUI registered in your network server. Note that your RAK3372 module has a sticker with a QR code printed on it. You can use the QR code information to configure the **OTAA_DEVEUI** parameter. The **OTAA_DEVEUI** format is MSB first.

```c
  // OTAA Device EUI MSB
#define OTAA_DEVEUI   {0x11, 0x33, 0x55, 0x77, 0x99, 0x22, 0x44, 0x66}
```
- The **OTAA_APPEUI** parameter. This parameter should also be the same as the **APPEUI** in the network server you configured.

```c
  // OTAA Application EUI MSB
#define OTAA_APPEUI   {0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x09}
```

- Another important parameter to change is the application key **OTAA_APPKEY**. This parameter should also be the same as the **APPKEY** in the network server you configured. The **OTAA_APPKEY** format is MSB first.

```c
// OTAA Application Key MSB
#define OTAA_APPKEY   {0x04, 0xFA, 0x4E, 0x62, 0x6E, 0xF5, 0xCF, 0x22, 0x7C, 0x96, 0x96, 0x01, 0x17, 0x62, 0x75, 0xC2}
```

3. Depending on the Regional Band you selected, you might need to configure the sub-band of your RAK module to match the gateway and LoRaWAN network server. This is especially important for Regional Bands like US915, AU915, and CN470.

This guide uses EU868. However, if you use other regional bands, you need to update the band and possibly the channels. For example, if you use US915 and AU915, you also need to set up the channel mask using the `mask.set` API. Channels 8 to 15 are the most commonly used channels in the US915 and AU915 bands which corresponds to a mask equal to two.

*Here's example on using US915 with OTAA_BAND equal to 5:*

```c
  if (!api.lorawan.band.set(OTAA_BAND)) {
    Serial.printf("LoRaWan OTAA - set band is incorrect! \r\n");
    return;
  }
  uint16_t maskBuff = 0x0002;
  if (!api.lorawan.mask.set(&maskBuff)) {
    Serial.printf("LoRaWan OTAA - set mask is incorrect! \r\n");
    return;
  }

```
