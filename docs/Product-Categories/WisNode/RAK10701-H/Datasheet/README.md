# RAK10701-H Field Mapper for Helium Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The **RAK10701-H Field Mapper for Helium Network** is a ready-to-use device for evaluating the coverage of the Helium Network. It is a plug-and-play device with its included DC (data credits), which allows you to use it immediately without needing extra configurations. It has a GNSS receiver for checking its current location and a touchscreen LCD for the user interface. It shows the number of hotspots the device can reach and other parameters like approximate distance, RSSI, and SNR.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
The latest RAK10701 Field Mapper firmware (custom mode) only works on the following LoRaWAN Network Servers: **Helium**, **The Things Network**, and **Chirpstack**.  
:::

:::tip üìù NOTE
The [source code of RAK10701](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK10701-Field-Tester) is open-sourced (except the RUI3 APIs).

The device has to be charged first if it comes fresh from shipping. There is a possibility that the battery was drained during its transport.
