##### Creating Your Own GNSS Tracker Firmware

Build your own GNSS Tracker firmware with our open-source code available on the [Github Repo](https://github.com/RAKWireless/LPWAN-Tracker-Solution). You can find their projects for both Arduino IDE and PlatformIO. The sources in the two projects are identical.

You can extend the functionality of the GNSS Tracker by using these sources. You can write, as well, your own GNSS Tracker application based on these sources.
