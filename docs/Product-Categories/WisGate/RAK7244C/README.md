rak_desc: RAK7244C is built with the RAK2245 Pi Hat stacked with the newest Raspberry Pi 4, along with the GPS module and Heat Sink, increasing its performance and thermal dissipation. The backhaul capabilities are enhanced with the additional RAK2013 Cellular Pi HAT for cellular connectivity. This allows the gateway to use its LTE modem to forward data to the Cloud.
