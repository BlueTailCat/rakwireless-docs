<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduino/rak811-evaluation-board/quickstart/4.ttn-context.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="The Things Stack diagram"
/>

As shown in **Figure 4**, The Things Stack is an open-source LoRaWAN Network Server suitable for global, geo-distributed public and private deployments as well as for small, local networks. The architecture follows the LoRaWAN Network Reference Model for standards compliance and interoperability. This project is actively maintained by [The Things Industries](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/).

LoRaWAN is a protocol for low-power wide-area networks. It allows for large-scale Internet of Things deployments where low-powered devices efficiently communicate with Internet-connected applications over long-range wireless connections.

The RAK811 board can be part of this ecosystem as a device, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple it is to send data to The Things Stack using the LoRaWAN protocol. To achieve this, the RAK811 board must be located inside the coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway connected to The Things Stack server.


#### Registration to TTN and Creating LoRaWAN Applications

1. The first step is to go to [The Things Network platform](https://console.cloud.thethings.network/) and select a cluster, as shown in **Figure 5**. The Things Industries adds more clusters from time to time so select the one close to your location. In this guide, Europe 1 is selected.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduino/rak811-evaluation-board/quickstart/t_image_1.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Selecting Cluster in TTN V3"
/>

You can use the same login credentials on the TTN V2 if you have one. If you have no account yet, you need to create one.

2. To register as a new user to TTN, click on **Login with The Things ID** then select **register** on the next page as shown in **Figure 6** and **Figure 7**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduino/rak811-evaluation-board/quickstart/t_image_2.png"

/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduino/rak811-evaluation-board/quickstart/t_image_3.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Registration of new account"
/>

3. You should now be on the step of creating your TTN account. Fill in all the necessary details and activate your account.

4. After creating an account, you should log in on the platform using your username/email and password then click **Submit**, as shown in **Figure 8**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduino/rak811-evaluation-board/quickstart/t_image_4.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Logging in to TTN platform"
/>

5. Click **Authorize** to proceed.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduino/rak811-evaluation-board/quickstart/t_image_5.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Authorization to TTN"
/>

6. Now that you are logged in to the platform, the next step is to create an application. Click **Create an application**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduino/rak811-evaluation-board/quickstart/t_image_6.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Creating TTN application for your LoRaWAN devices"
/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduino/rak811-evaluation-board/quickstart/t_image_7.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Details of the TTN application"
/>

If you have no error on the previous step, you should now be on the application console page. The next step is to add end-devices to your The Things Stack application. LoRaWAN specifications enforce that each end device has to be personalized and activated. There are two options for registering devices depending on the activation mode selected. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or Activation-By-Personalization (ABP).

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Once you have the application in The Things Stack (TTN V3), you need to ensure that you are in coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway that is registered to The Things Stack (TTN V3) as well. Without the coverage of that LoRaWAN gateway, you cannot activate any device that you will register in your application.

RAKwireless has [LoRaWAN gateways](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisgate) that you can connect to The Things Stack (TTN V3) if no LoRaWAN gateway coverage is available in your location.

:::

#### The Things Stack OTAA Device Registration

1. Go to your application console to register a device. To start adding an OTAA end device, click **+ Add end device**, as shown in **Figure 12**.

  width="100%"
  caption="Device activation configuration"
/>

3. Then you need to put a unique **End device ID** and EUIs (**DevEUI** and **AppEUI**), as shown in **Figure 15**. Check if your board has a DevEUI on sticker or QR that you can scan then use this as the device‚Äôs unique DevEUI. The **AppEUI** cannot be all zero as well for the RAK811 Evaluation Board, else the device will have errors when it connects to the network server.

4. Optionally, you can add a more descriptive **End device name** and **End device description** about your device.

5. After putting all the details, you need to click **Network layer settings** to proceed to the next step.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

#### LoRaWAN Join Mode

In LoRaWAN, there are two ways a node can connect itself to the LoRaWAN network. This is referred to as **Join Mode**. LoRaWAN allows the OTAA mode and the ABP mode. In this section, the configuration process of these two modes, both on the platform side and the node side will be explained.

##### OTAA Mode

###### Configure the OTAA Mode on the Platform

1. If you have selected ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_OTAA**‚Äù, as shown in **Figure 43**, then after the device is created, an Application Key must be also created for this device.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduino/rak811-evaluation-board/quickstart/32.otaa.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA Activation"
/>

2. A previously created Application Key can be entered here, or a new one can be generated automatically by clicking the icon highlighted in red in **Figure 44**:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduino/rak811-evaluation-board/quickstart/33.otaa-set-device-keys.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA Set Application Keys"
/>

3. Once the Application Key is added to the form, the process can be finalized by clicking on the ‚Äú**SET DEVICE-KEYS**‚Äù button.

* As shown in **Figure 45**, a new device should be listed in the DEVICES tab. The most important parameters, such as the Device EUI are shown in the summary.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduino/rak811-evaluation-board/quickstart/34.set-device-eui.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA List of Device in the Device Tab"
/>

4. To end the process, it is a good practice to review that the Application Key is properly associated with this device. The Application Key can be verified in the **KEYS(OTAA)** tab, as shown in **Figure 46**.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduino/rak811-evaluation-board/quickstart/35.application-key.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Key Associated with the New Device"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Standard OTAA mode requires the **Device EUI**, **Application Key**, and **Application EUI**, but in the ChirpStack‚Äôs implementation, only the Device EUI and the Application Key are mandatory. The Application EUI is not required and not recorded in the Application tab. Nevertheless, the Application EUI is a mandatory parameter in the RAK811 board‚Äôs firmware. In order to resolve this mismatch, you can reuse the Device EUI as the Application EUI during the configuration on the side of the node.

:::

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the RAK811

The RAK811 board supports a series of [AT commands](/Product-Categories/WisDuino/RAK811-Evaluation-Board/AT-Command-Manual/) to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If you got any error related to the AT Commands, you can always check the [Error Code Table](/Product-Categories/WisDuino/RAK811-Evaluation-Board/AT-Command-Manual/#error-code-table) to get more insights.
:::

To set up the RAK811 Evaluation Board to join Chirpstack using OTAA, you need to connect to the PC via USB cable and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending either of these two AT commands:

```
at+set_config=device:restart
```

```
at+version
```


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduino/rak811-evaluation-board/quickstart/3.command-response.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="at+version command response"
/>

As an example, these are the list of the parameters you need to configure in RAK811:

- LoRa join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRa class: **Class A**
- LoRa region: **EU868**
- Device EUI: **5e9d1e0857cf25f1**
- Application EUI: **5e9d1e0857cf25f1**
- Application Key: **f921d50cd7d02ee3c5e6142154f274b2**

:::tip üìù NOTE:

You need to set valid values to the Device EUI, Application EUI, and Application Key. It cannot be all zero values else it will cause an error once the device attempts to join the network server.

:::

1. Set the LoRa join mode to OTAA.

```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:0
```

2. Set the LoRa class to Class A.

```
at+set_config=lora:class:0
```

3. Set the frequency/region to EU868.

- Refer to the [RAK811 Datasheet](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK811-Module/Datasheet/#rf-characteristics) for the list of supported frequencies.


```
at+set_config=lora:region:EU868
```

4. Set the Device EUI.

```
at+set_config=lora:dev_eui:5e9d1e0857cf25f1
```

5. Set the Application EUI.

```
at+set_config=lora:app_eui:5e9d1e0857cf25f1
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Remember, the Application EUI parameter is not required in the ChirpStack platform; therefore, it is possible to use the same id as the Device EUI. Otherwise, the firmware will complain.
:::

6. Set the Application Key.

- Get the Application Key from the ChirpStack console.

```
at+set_config=lora:app_key:f921d50cd7d02ee3c5e6142154f274b2
```

  caption="Chirpstack OTAA configuration via RAK Serial Port Tool"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:
After configuring all the parameters, you need to reset the RAK811 Evaluation Board to save the parameters.
:::

7. After resetting, start to join.

```
at+join
```

<rk-img

9. Try to send data from RAK811 Evaluation Board to ChirpStack.

```
at+send=lora:2:1234567890
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduino/rak811-evaluation-board/quickstart/40.send-message-chirpstack.png"
  width="45%"
  caption="Send a LoRaWAN Message via RAK Serial Port Tool"
/>

- On the ChirpStack platform, you should also see the messages in the LORAWAN FRAMES tab, as shown in **Figure 52**. By convention, messages sent from nodes to gateways are considered as **Uplinks** while messages sent by gateways to nodes are considered as **Downlinks**.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduino/rak811-evaluation-board/quickstart/41.message-received.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack Data Received Preview"
/>

This concludes the exercise to send data in the OTAA mode.



##### ABP Mode

###### Configure the ABP Mode on the Platform

1. During the registration of a new device, if you select ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_ABP**‚Äù, as shown in **Figure 53**, then the ChirpStack platform will assume that this device will join the LoRaWAN network using the ABP mode.


:::tip üìù NOTE:

Check ‚Äú**Disable counting frame verification**‚Äù. During the test, when the module is restarted, the frame counting number will also be restarted from zero. This would cause a synchronization problem with the ChirpStack server treating it as a replay attack. For the testing purpose, it is safe to disable this feature, but remember to activate it in a production environment.

  width="100%"
  caption="ChirpStack Console, Configuring a Device"
/>

2. After selecting the ABP mode, the following parameters appear in the Activation tab:

Then, you can see that there are some parameters for ABP in the **‚ÄúACTIVATION‚Äù** item:

  * **Device address**
  * **Network Session Key**
  * **Application Session Key**

3. The parameters can be generated as random numbers by the platform or can be set with user values. Once these parameters are filled in properly, the process is completed by clicking on the ‚Äú**ACTIVATE DEVICE**‚Äù button.


###### Configure the ABP Mode on the RAK811

In the following steps, you will configure the RAK811 board to work in the ABP mode. To set up the RAK811 Evaluation Board to join Chirpstack using ABP, you need to connect to the PC via USB cable and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending either of these two AT commands:

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If you got any error related to the AT Commands, you can always check the [Error Code Table](/Product-Categories/WisDuino/RAK811-Evaluation-Board/AT-Command-Manual/#error-code-table) to get more insights.

As an example, these are the list of the parameters you need to configure in RAK811:

- LoRa join mode: **ABP**
- LoRa class: **Class A**
- LoRa region: **EU868**
- Device address: **26011af9**
- Network Session Key: **c280cb8d1df688bc18601a97025c5488**
- Application Session Key: **4d42ec5caf97f03d833cdaf5003f69e1**

:::tip üìù NOTE:

You need to set valid values to the Device address, Network Session Key, and Application Session Key. It cannot be all zero values else it will cause an error once the device attempts to join the network server.

:::

1. Set LoRa join mode to ABP.

```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:1
```

2. Set LoRa class to Class A.

```
at+set_config=lora:class:0
```

3. Set the frequency/region to EU868.

- Refer to the [RAK811 Datasheet](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK811-Module/Datasheet/#rf-characteristics) for the list of supported frequencies.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

By using the ABP mode in the LoRaWAN protocol, it doesn‚Äôt require to join a network before sending the LoRaWAN package. But, to keep the consistency of internal states of the firmware of the RAK811 board, it is still required to send `at+join` command in the ABP mode. This time, the firmware should reply almost immediately with an ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.

:::

8. Try to send data from RAK811 Evaluation Board to ChirpStack.

```

### LoRa P2P Mode

This section will show you how to set up and connect two RAK811 units to work in the LoRa P2P mode. You will be using EU868 as your frequency, although it applies also to other standard bands.

1. Two RAK811 units shall be set to operate on EU868 frequency.

2. The setup of the RAK811 units is done by connecting them with a general-purpose computer through the UART port. The setup of each RAK811 can be done separately, but testing the LoRa P2P mode will require having both units connected simultaneously to their respective UART port. This could be one computer with two USB ports or two computers with one USB port each.

3. Set the RAK811 to work in LoRa P2P mode. Open the RAK Serial Port Tool and send the following command:

:::tip üìù NOTE:

If you got any error related to the AT Commands, you can always check the [Error Code Table](/Product-Categories/WisDuino/RAK811-Evaluation-Board/AT-Command-Manual/#error-code-table) to get more insights.

```
at+set_config=lora:work_mode:1
```

  caption="P2P Initialization"
/>

4. Then, configure LoRa P2P parameters for both of them.


```
at+set_config=lorap2p:XXX:Y:Z:A:B:C
```

For this example, the LoRa parameters are the following:

- Link frequency: **869525000&nbsp;Hz**
- Spreading factor: **7**
- Bandwidth: **125&nbsp;kHz**
- Coding Rate: **4/5**
- Preamble Length: **5**
- Power: **5&nbsp;dBm**

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Refer to the [Configuring Using AT Commands](/Product-Categories/WisDuino/RAK811-Evaluation-Board/AT-Command-Manual/) section to learn more about the definition of the parameters used.

:::

Hence, it is translated into the following RAK811 AT command and sent to both units.

```
at+set_config=lorap2p:869525000:7:0:1:5:5
```

5. Set the transmission mode of the module. Unit 1 is configured as the sender, and Unit 2 is set to the receiver by AT command.

```
at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:2

at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:1

### Interfacing with Arduino Boards

The updated hardware and software guide on interfacing the RAK811 Evaluation Board to Arduino is completely discussed in the [WisNode Arduino Library repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisNode-Arduino-Library).

#### Requirements:

- WisDuino RAK811 Evaluation Board (v1.1 or v1.2)
- Gateway in range for testing
- Arduino Uno.
- External USB-UART TTL Converter
- Jumper wires

#### Arduino Hardware Preparation

The guide uses Arduino Uno as the host but can be adapted on other boards as well.

There are two versions of the RAK811 Evaluation Board and hardware configuration will depend on the board version.

- [WisDuino RAK811 Evaluation Board V1.1 guide](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisNode-Arduino-Library/blob/master/Documents%20and%20tools/WisNodeV1.1%20Arduino%20Library/RAK811%20WisNode%20V1.1%20Hardware.md).
- [WisDuino RAK811 Evaluation Board V1.2 guide](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisNode-Arduino-Library/blob/master/Documents%20and%20tools/WisNodeV1.2%20Arduino%20Library/RAK811%20WisNode%20V1.2%20Hardware.md).

#### Arduino Software Preparation

Same with the hardware, the software library will be based on your board version.

- [Library for WisDuino Board V1.1](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisNode-Arduino-Library/tree/master/Documents%20and%20tools/WisNodeV1.1%20Arduino%20Library).
- [Library for WisDuino Board V1.2](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisNode-Arduino-Library/tree/master/Documents%20and%20tools/WisNodeV1.2%20Arduino%20Library).

The installation guide of these libraries can be found on the [main GitHub repository of WisNode-Arduino-Library](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisNode-Arduino-Library).

These libraries have included LoRaWAN examples of both OTAA and ABP, as well as an example for LoRa-P2P communication.

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
The library uses the Software Serial library of Arduino to communicate to the RAK811 via pin 10 and pin 11.
Because of this, the RAK811 needs to be configured to a 9600 baud rate for this library to work.
