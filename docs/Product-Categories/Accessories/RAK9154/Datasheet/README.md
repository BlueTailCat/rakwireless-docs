#### Environmental Requirements

##### Standard Experiment Condition

Unless otherwise stated, all specifications are performed under the following environmental conditions:

- Temperature: 25¬±3¬∞&nbsp;C
- Humidity: 65¬±20%&nbsp;RH 

#### Transportation and Storage

##### Transportation Requirements

During transportation, the battery should be protected from severe vibration, shock, sun, and rain. It should not be inverted to avoid short circuits from happening. During the loading and the unloading process, it should be handled gently to prevent falling, rolling, heavy pressure, and inversion.

##### Storage Requirements

The module is stored in an incompletely charged state, typically around 40%&nbsp;SOC. Product storage environment requirements are as follows:

- **Storage temperature:** Storage time < 3 months, then stored at -20 ~ 55¬∞&nbsp;C, 40%&nbsp;SOC; Storage time > 3 months, then 0 ~ 25¬∞&nbsp;C, 40%&nbsp;SOC.
- **Storage humidity:** Humidity is 2 ~ 90%&nbsp;RH, it is recommended to store in the range of no more than 85%&nbsp;RH.
- **Storage environment:** The product should be stored in a clean, ventilated, and cool environment, avoiding direct sunlight, high temperature, corrosive gas, severe vibration, mechanical shock, and heavy pressure; away from heat source; altitude is less than 1500&nbsp;meters, atmospheric pressure is 86~106&nbsp;kPa.
- **Maintenance:** In a dry and ventilated environment, recharging is required once a month during storage. The maintenance test method during product storage is as follows: Under normal temperature conditions, the product should be charged and discharged once a month with standard charging. If the module is expected to be stored for more than 30 days, the SOC will be adjusted to 40% after the charging is completed.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
This product must comply with the operating instructions. Any installation, maintenance, and use of this product must strictly comply with the relevant safety regulations.

- Do not store or use at high temperatures, and must be kept away from heat. These environments above the safe temperature range can cause significant degradation in the performance and life of the product, and even cause serious consequences such as burning and explosion.
- Storage and use in environments with high static or high electromagnetic radiation are prohibited. Otherwise, the electronic components in this product may be damaged, which may cause safety hazards.
- Do not get it wet or even soak it in water. Otherwise, it may cause internal short circuits, loss of function, or abnormal chemical reactions of the product, and cause fire, smoke, explosion, and other accidents.
- If you find any abnormalities such as smoke, high heat, discoloration or deformation, while in use, storage, transportation, and service, you should contact the professional department immediately to further observe and control the risks.
- Do not dispose discarded products in fire or hot furnaces. Waste batteries should be recycled and recycling should be done by professional agencies or organizations.
- Do not let the product carry heavy load or pressure. It should not be stacked on top of each other.
- Although this battery is not a high-pressure energy storage device, non-professionals, and improper operation and use may still cause serious consequences such as burning and explosion. The installation and maintenance of the battery system must be operated by professional technicians. Its usage must strictly abide by the relevant safety regulations; non-professionals are strictly prohibited to install, repairing battery systems and abuse.
