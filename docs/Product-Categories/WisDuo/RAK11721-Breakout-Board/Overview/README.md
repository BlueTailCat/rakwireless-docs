# RAK11721 Breakout Board

Thank you for choosing **RAK11721 Breakout Board** in your awesome IoT project! ðŸŽ‰ To help you get started, we have provided you with all the necessary documentation for your product.

* [AT Command Manual](../AT-Command-Manual/)
* [Datasheet](../Datasheet/)

## Product Description

**RAK11721 Breakout Board** is specifically designed to allow easy access to the pins on the board to simplify development and testing. The breakout board footprint is based on the **XBee form factor**, and its main purpose is to allow the RAK11720 stamp module pins to be accessible via the 2.54&nbsp;mm headers.

The board itself has the RAK11720 at its core, integrating an **Ambiq Apollo3 Blue AMA3B1KK-KBR-B0 SoC MCU** chip and **Semtech SX1262** LoRa transceiver. It has an ultra-low power consumption of 2.37&nbsp;uA in sleep mode.

This module complies with Class A, B, & C of LoRaWAN 1.0.3 specifications. It also supports LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communication mode, which helps you in implementing your own customized long-range LoRa network quickly.
