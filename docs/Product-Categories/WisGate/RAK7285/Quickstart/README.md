:::tip üìù NOTE

The pole supported by the brackets has a diameter ranging from 50~100&nbsp;mm. If the pole diameter exceeds 100&nbsp;mm, you can use steel strips instead. The standard mounting kit does not include steel strips, they are sold separately.

5. Attach the LoRa, Wi-Fi, and GPS antennas. If you choose the LTE variant, you also need to attach the LTE antennas.

#### Connecting the PoE Adapter

1. Connect the Ethernet cable from the enclosure to the Ethernet port labeled PoE adapter.
2. Connect an Ethernet cable from your LAN network to the Ethernet port labeled LAN on the adapter.
3. Connect one end of the power cord to the adapter, and the other end to a power outlet.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

Do not connect the adapter to the power outlet unless all installations are completed.

#### Weather Protection

To better protect the Ethernet cable gland and the antenna connector from the weather, you need to cover them with PVC tape.

1. Clean the surface of the connector that will be covered. Wrap a layer of PVC tape with a 50% overlap according to the rotation direction of the connector. Continue wrapping the PVC tape to about 10&nbsp;mm below the end of the connector.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7285/quickstart/8.pvc-tape.png"
  width="35%"
  caption="Wrapping with PVC tape"
/>

2. Cut off about 50&nbsp;cm of the waterproof tape, and stretch it to double its length. Wrap three layers around the connector with a 50% overlap. Hold the tape in place with your hand for a few seconds.

#### Lightning Protection

This section covers the installation of the lightning surge protection system, addressing both indoor and outdoor placements of your RAK7285 WisGate Edge Ultra. Such a protection system must be taken into consideration to ensure a fully functional gateway without interruption or damage from the lighting.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7285/quickstart/11.lightning-protection.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Full lightning protection set-up"
/>

##### Outdoor Surge Protection System

- **Antenna Grounding**: RAKwireless recommends a lightning arrestor to be installed on all the antenna N-type terminals. The arrestors have to be N-type Female to Male to fit the antenna and enclosure connectors. Make sure you use a 10&nbsp;AWG or better wire to connect the screw terminals of the arrestors to the grounding rail mounted on the building wall (grounding bar in case of field deployment).
- **Gateway Grounding**: Additionally, it is recommended to use another 10&nbsp;AWG or better grounding wire to connect the screw terminal on the bottom left side of the gateway casing to the grounding rail (bar).

:::tip üìù NOTE
No additional protection for the Ethernet cabling is required at the gateway side. It already has a built-in surge protection system (GDT + Anti-surge resistor).
:::

##### Indoor Surge Protection

For protecting the indoor equipment and circuitry connected to the gateway, it is recommended to install an Ethernet port SPD lightning arrestor. It should be positioned along the cabling connecting the gateway to the PoE injector. Make sure you connect its grounding wire terminal to an appropriate building grounding point.


:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

Should you fail to adhere to the recommendations in this document, RAKwireless carries no responsibility for any damage your equipment incurs due to a lightning strike.

:::

### Access the Gateway

In this section, several ways of accessing the gateway are provided to have different alternatives for you to choose from depending on the availability of the requirements needed.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

Do not power the device if the LoRa antenna port has been left open to avoid potential damage to the RAK7285 WisGate Edge Ultra.

:::

#### Wi-Fi AP Mode

By default, the gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode, which means that you can find an SSID, named **RAK7285_XXXX** on your PC's Wi-Fi network list. `XXXX` is the last two bytes of the gateway's MAC address.

1. To access the Web Management Platform, input the following IP Address in your Web browser: `192.168.230.1`.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7285/quickstart/access-the-gateway.jpg"
  width="70%"
  caption="Accessing the gateway via Wi-Fi AP mode"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE

No password is required to connect via Wi-Fi.

:::

2. Using your preferred Web browser, input the aforementioned IP address and you should see the Login Page.

#####  Set Login Password

1. For security reasons, upon the first log in, you must set a login password. This is done by filling in the desired password and confirming it in the provided fields. The password needs to comply with the following rules:

- At least 12 characters long.
- Has at least one special character (!‚Äú#$%&\‚Äò()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_`{|}~).
- Has at least one number.
- Has at least one standard Latin letter (used in the English alphabet).

<rk-img

  width="100%"
  caption="Web UI login page"
/>


2. When the fields are filled in, click the **Set password** button to apply it. The web UI is now accessible and it will load the **LoRaWAN Statistics page**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7285/quickstart/18.stat-page.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="LoRaWAN statistics page"
/>



3. On the next log in, you need to use the set password for access. The default login username is **root**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7285/quickstart/19.set-password.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Login Page with set password"
/>


#### WAN Port (Ethernet)

1. Connect the Ethernet cable to the port marked **ETH** on the gateway, and the other end to the PoE port of the PoE injector. Connect the LAN port of the PoE injector to your PC.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7285/quickstart/14.wan-port.jpg"
  width="70%"
  caption="Accessing the gateway via WAN Port (Ethernet)"
/>

2. The default IP is **`169.254.X.X`**, where the last two segments are mapped from the last four bits of your gateway'S MAC address.
  - For example, the last four bits of the MAC address are `0F:01` and the IP address is `169.254.15.1`.
  - Make sure to manually set the address of your PC to one in the same network (for example, `169.254.15.100`).

3. To do this, open the head to the **Ethernet Properties** and click the **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**.
<rk-img
    src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7285/quickstart/15.internet-properties.png"
    width="45%"
    caption="Internet properties"
/>

4. Select **Use the following IP address** and set the IP address (for example, `169.254.15.100`).

<rk-img
    src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7285/quickstart/16.set-ip-address.png"

2. You can either click the **Scan** button to choose your **ESSID** or manually type the ESSID of the network by clicking **enter network (E)SSID manually**.
3. Select the right **Encryption** method and enter the correct **Key**.

:::tip üìù NOTE
Assuming you have entered the correct parameter values, you should get an IP address assigned by your Wi-Fi router's (AP) built-in DHCP server. You can use this new IP address to log in via a web browser (the same way as in AP mode).
:::

#### Connect Through Ethernet/PoE

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7285/quickstart/20.access-thru-ethernet.jpg"
