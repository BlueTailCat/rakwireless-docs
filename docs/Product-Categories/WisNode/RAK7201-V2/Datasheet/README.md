| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Button 1 | Long press **button 1** for three seconds to send a join request. Short-press **button 1** to send button 1 data. The data can be personalized with an AT command.                                            |
| Button 2 | Long-press **button 2** for three seconds to reset the device. Short-press **button 2** to send button 2 data. The data can be personalized with an AT command.                                               |
| Button 3 | Long-press **button 3** to display the battery level (blue LED battery indicator<sup><b><i>1</i></b></sup>). Short-press **button 3** to send button 3 data. The data can be personalized with an AT command. |
| Button 4 | Short-press **button 4** to send button 4 data. The data can be personalized with an AT command.                                                                                                              |

<sup><b><i>1</i></b></sup>The percentage charge is identified by the number of lit blue LEDs. Each LED represents 25% of the battery charge. 1 lit blue LED indicates a 1โ25% charge, two lit blue LEDs indicate a 26โ50% charge, and so on.

##### LEDs

There are four RGB LEDs, one per button. The following table shows the LEDs' status:
