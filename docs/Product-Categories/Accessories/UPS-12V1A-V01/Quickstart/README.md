1. Connect the DC 12&nbsp;V adapter to the UPS12V1A-V01 5.5 x 2.1&nbsp;mm input port.
2. Attach the RAK7268 to the UPS 12V1A-V01 DC 5.5 x 2.5&nbsp;mm output port.
3. Turn on the UPS12V1A-V01 device switch.


:::tip üìù NOTE:
- Fully charge the UPS12V1A-V01 before using it for the first time.
- The UPS12V1A-V01 will only be charged when the power switch is turned on.
- As an uninterruptible power supply, the UPS12V1A-V01 is normally turned on.
- To avoid interfering with the adapter's operation, the UPS12V1A-V01 has a low charging current but a high capacity, so the charging time is approximately 8 hours.

## Storage Conditions

When the UPS12V1A-V01 is stored, the self-discharge rate is affected by the ambient temperature. Remove it from the RAK7268 and fully charge it if it will not be used for a long time. Then turn it off and store it in a cool, dry place.
The UPS12V1A-V01 should not be stored without charging for more than the time indicated below:

- Storage for 1 month: -20¬∞&nbsp;C ~ 60¬∞&nbsp;C
- Storage for 3 months: -20¬∞&nbsp;C ~ 45¬∞&nbsp;C
- Storage for 6 months: -20¬∞&nbsp;C ~ 25¬∞&nbsp;C

In addition, charge it regularly (once every 3~5 months) to prevent excessive discharge. An excessive discharge will affect the battery‚Äôs performance and function. The charging time is approximately 4~5 hours, and the voltage is maintained between 11.1&nbsp;V ~ 12.6&nbsp;V.
