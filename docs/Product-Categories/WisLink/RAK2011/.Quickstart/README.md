##### NB-IoT UDP Communication Test

Execute the following steps to test the NB-IoT UDP Communication:

1. Plug in the NB-IoT SIM card.
2. Connect the RAK2011 WisLink Cellular to a Windows PC.
3. Select Quectel USB AT Port corresponding to the COM port.
4. Open the serial port tool.
5. Send the listed AT commands to have the BG96 module find a NB-IoT network.

::: tip üìù NOTE

China Telecom's NB-IoT SIM card is used in this example. Modify the AT commands as required according to the NB-IoT network being used to provide your service. For more information on AT commands, refer to the Quectel BG96 Network Searching Scheme Introduction.

:::

```
AT+QCFG="NWSCANSEQ",03 // Set the scanning network to NB-IoT network
AT+QCFG="IOTOPMODE",1
AT+QCFG="BAND",0,10,10 // Set the scan channel to BAND5
AT+QCFG="NBSIBSCRAMBLE",0
```

You can also manually search the current network to connect. Use the following commands to do manual search and connection:

```
AT+COPS=? // Manually search the current network
AT+COPS=1,0,"CHN-CT",9 // Manually connect NB-IoT network
```

  width="80%"
  caption="Check Network Signal Strength"
/>

7. After connecting to the network, you need to set up the APN and activate the APN network. You can set the APN by sending the following commands:

```
AT+QICSGP=1,1,"CTNB","","",1 // Set APN parameters
AT+QIACT=1 // Activate APN
AT+QIACT? // Query the APN assigned IP address

```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wislink-lte/rak2011/quickstart/setup-activate-apn.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Setup and Activate APN"
/>

8. After activating the APN, you can establish a UDP connection. (In China Telecom‚Äôs NB-IoT network, you must first inform the operator of your server‚Äôs IP address. The operator will make binding before the connection is successful. The behavior of other networks might be different).

```
AT+QIOPEN=1,0,"UDP","202.120.2.101",123,0,0 //Establish UDP connection
AT+QISTATE? // Query connection is successful
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wislink-lte/rak2011/quickstart/establish-udp-connection.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Establish UDP Connection"
/>

9. When sending data to the server, there will be a prompt to receive data "recv". If there is no prompt you can send the following commands to check if there is data reception:

```
AT+QISENDEX=0,"db0011fa0000587f0009031d00000000dd99732a8e147ae10000000
0000000000000000000000000dd997618cb851eb8" // send data
AT+QISEND=0,0 // Query data is sent successfully
AT+QIRD=0,1500 // Check if there is data received, if there is,
print it out directly
```

```

For detailed GPS command description, refer to Quectel BG96 GNSS AT Commands Manual.

5. After sending the command, the GPS Function Test is completed. 


#### Connect Through an Arduino Header Interface

The RAK2011 also supports Arduino headers as defined by Arduino UNO R3. Download the [Arduino library](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisLTE_Arduino) for RAK2011 and then refer to the Datasheet for the RAK2011 Arduino Header [pin definition](). 

Here is a test communication program to verify communication between an Arduino MCU base board and RAK2011. 

```

void setup()
{
// put your setup code here, to run once:
Serial.begin(115200);
while (!Serial)
{
; // wait for serial port to connect. For native USB port only
}
}
void loop()
{
// put your main code here to run repeatedly:
if (Serial.available())
{
Serial.write(Serial.read());
}
}

```

##### Receive Data

Receiving data is similar to sending data, except that the established socket is different. The receiving data is established as a TCP server. The AT commands sent are shown below:

```

COPS=?       // Find nearby network information
AT+COPS=1,0,"CHINA MOBILE",0   // Manually set up a connected network
AT+CREG?      // Check whether the device is registered on the network
AT+QNWINFO      // Query connected network information
AT+COPS?      // Query the connected web server information
AT+QICSGP=1,1,"hologram","","",1    // Set APN network to hologram
AT+QIACT=1     // Activate the APN network
AT+QIACT?     // Query the APN assigned IP address
AT+QIOPEN=1,1,"TCP LISTENER","127.0.0.1",0,2020,0     // Create a TCP server, use local IP, port 2020
AT+QIRD=11,1500    // Read the received data, 11 is the returned Socket identifier

```


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wislink-lte/rak2011/quickstart/tcp-server.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Create a TCP server"
