# RAK19010 WisBlock Base Board with Power Slot Datasheet
## Overview

### Description

**RAK19010** is a **WisBlock Base Board with Power Slot** that connects **WisBlock Core** and other **WisBlock Modules**. The power slot of RAK19010 is required to have an attached WisBlock Power Slot module that provides power supply to the core and other modules. There are many different types of power slot modules compatible with RAK19010 and the choice will depend on the type of application.

It has one slot reserved for the power slot module, one for the core module, one slot for the IO module, and four sensor slots A-D for small WisBlock modules. The WisBlock Core, Power, and IO modules are attached on the top side, and smaller WisBlock modules can be attached to the top or bottom side of the RAK19010. Slot A and D hold modules up to 23&nbsp;mm in size, while all slots A up to D support 10&nbsp;mm WisBlock modules. Also, there are three **2.54&nbsp;mm pitch headers** for extension interface with **BOOT**, **GPIO**, **ADC**, **I2C**, and **UART** pins.

WisBlock modules are connected to the RAK19010 WisBlock Base board via high-speed board-to-board connectors. They provide secure and reliable interconnection to ensure the signal integrity of each data bus. A set of screws is used to fix the modules, making it reliable even in an environment with lots of vibrations.

You can also use a [RAK19005 WisBlock Sensor Extension Cable](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/fpc-extension-cable-for-slot-a-to-d-rak19005) or [RAK19008 WisBlock IO Extension Cable](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-io-extension-cable-rak19008) to position the WisBlock modules apart from the WisBlock Base board or in any part of your case.

### Features

- **Size**
    * **RAK19010** has a size of only 30 x 60&nbsp;mm, which lets you create solutions that fit into the smallest housings.

If you can't find a WisBlock module that fits your IoT requirements, use the standard connectors of WisBlock to develop your specific function module. WisBlock supports open-source hardware architecture and you can find tutorials showing how to create your own [Awesome WisBlock](https://github.com/RAKWireless/Awesome-WisBlock) module.

### Applications

- Wireless sensor network
- Environmental monitoring
- Wireless data transmission
- Data acquisition in the industrial environment
- Location and tracking of personnel or moving objects

## Specifications

### Overview

There are seven (7) slots on RAK19010 WisBlock Base Board with Power Slot:

- **CPU SLOT**: This slot is reserved for the WisBlock Core module which has the main MCU.
- **Power SLOT**: This slot is required to provide power to WisBlock Core and modules.
- **IO SLOT**: This slot is used for IO extension modules.
- **Four Sensor Slots**: The sensor slots A to D are used to connect with the I2C bus. Slots A and D can be used for GNSS modules, too.

Also, there are pin headers 2.54&nbsp;mm pitch for the extension interface that connects to BOOT, I2C, UART, ADC, and GPIO pins.
