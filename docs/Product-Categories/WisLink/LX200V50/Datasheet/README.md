# LX200V50 WisLink 1000 Mbps PLC Module + EVB Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

**LX200V50** is a Power Line Communication (PLC) module based on Qualcomm QCA7550 System-on-Chip (SoC). QCA7550 is a MAC/PHY transceiver module that meets the HPAV2 standard. It is designed to bridge multi-stream Ethernet content from a powerline network to an Ethernet 802.3 network. The PLC's specific MAC manages network admission and service flows to maximize the Quality of Service (QoS) over the powerline network.

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into five parts. It shows the interfacing and the pinouts of the board and their corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical and mechanical parameters of the LX200V50 WisLink 1000&nbsp;Mbps PLC Module + EVB.


#### Interfaces

##### Evaluation Board (EVB)

The EVB can be used for the customer's product development and testing, and can also be used as a part of the research and development of products. The baseboard is designed for all the external interface circuits required by the module, including coupling parts such as 3.3&nbsp;V buck, Ethernet RJ45, PLC coupling transmission transformer, and other interfaces. It is mainly the interface. The structure of each product is different. The auxiliary interface evaluation board is designed to be convenient for testing.
