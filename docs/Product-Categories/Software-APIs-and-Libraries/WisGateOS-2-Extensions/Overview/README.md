# WisGateOS 2 Extensions

## Overview

WisGateOS 2 features an extension functionality, which provides additional features and functions that can be added or removed, based on your needs. Later this year, RAKwireless will provide the option for our users to build their own extensions.

The extensions are built to work with version 2 gateways running the WisGateOS 2.

::: tip üìù NOTE
Some extensions will be available for certain gateway models since they are related to specific hardware functionality.

### Breathing Light

The breathing light LED is located on the top cover of the WisGate Edge Lite 2 gateways and helps to easily determine the gateway‚Äôs status visually. The breathing light extension allows you to enable or disable the breathing light on the gateway‚Äôs top cover. The default state of the LED is as in its Normal state - a slowly blinking blue light.

::: tip üìù NOTE
Breathing Light extension is available only for the WisGate Edge Lite 2 version 2 gateways.
:::

<rk-btn

  label="Download Breathing Light Extension"
  size="1.5rem"
  _blank
/>

#### Working Modes

By using the breathing light extension you can personalize the LED light‚Äôs working modes, frequency, and color. There are two working modes. The first one is All. If you choose it, the LED light will be active when your gateway is working properly. The second work mode is Warning only ‚Äì the LED light signifies if there is some kind of malfunction.

If you choose Warning only mode, the LED light will only work in case of abnormal activities. For instance, in case of a lost Internet connection. In Warning only mode, you can modify the light color, but not its frequency.

#### Configuring the Extension

If you choose the All working mode, you can change the Normal light color, that is the light you see when the gateway is working properly. The blinking frequency can be changed as well ‚Äì you can choose from Slow, Fast, and Steady. It‚Äôs possible to configure the color of the Warning light in All working mode as well. Note that the colors for the Normal and the Warning Light cannot be the same.

1. Start by Installing and **Launching** the extension.

### Country Settings/LBT

LBT (Listen Before Talk) means that, before transmitting, the gateway checks the availability of the channel. This is necessary because LoRaWAN is a multi-channel protocol and uses ISM Band. Anyone can use the band - a collision occurs if two or more end devices send signals simultaneously.

The gateway checks for empty channels and uses one of them to send downlink data. If a channel is occupied, the gateway performs a random back off. In case all of the channels are occupied, the gateway waits for a free channel and tries to send the downlink data again.

LBT is usually governed by regulations per country. In WisGateOS 2.1, there is a country table which includes proper configurations for all countries so you can set the country code in WisGateOS 2.1.

:::tip üìù NOTE

AS923 end-devices operating in Japan shall perform Listen Before Talk (LBT), based on ARIB STD-T108 regulations. The ARIB STD-T108 regulation is available for free and should be consulted as needed.
:::


You can switch the frequency plan in the following regions:

* AS923, KR920
* EU868, RU864, IN865
* CN470

The frequency plan will be limited to a particular region. Tx power will be limited to under the maximum.


* Downlink Tx Power
* Beacon Tx Power

### Wireguard


WireGuard is a simple but fast VPN. It aims to be faster, simpler, and leaner than the IPsec protocol. It intends to be more performant than the well-known RAKwireless - OpenVPN. Before, it was not possible to use the WireGuard protocol on the RAKwireless gateways, but that is not the case now.

The new WisGateOS V2 now offers Extension features, where you can install and set up the WireGuard extension. In this tutorial, you will learn how to set the WireGuard client on the gateway.

This guide assumes that you have some knowledge in setting up a WireGuard server and have a WireGuard server set up. <!--If you are not familiar with the WireGuard server, you can check this link <mark><link></mark>  to learn how to set up a WireGuard server.-->

:::tip üìù NOTE
WireGuard extension can only be installed on WisGate Edge V2 gateways, with WisGateOS 2 only.

### OpenVPN

OpenVPN is a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN is created where a server is deployed that both the Gateway and any number of customer devices (PC, Phone, etc.) can connect to via a public IP address. This is possible to implement using any of the backhaul connectivity options the Gateway supports (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, LTE). For the LTE backhaul, make sure that the gateway has a static public IP.

Thus, by connecting to the server via a remote client, the user can remotely manage the gateway from any point, at any time. As mentioned above, an OpenVPN server is required. This guide shows how to set up a server in the AWS cloud.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The OpenVPN extension can only be installed on WisGate Edge V2 gateways, operating with WisGateOS 2.
