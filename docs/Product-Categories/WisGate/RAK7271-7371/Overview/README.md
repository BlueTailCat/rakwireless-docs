## Product Description

The RAK Developer Base is a device designed for integration with desktop/mobile/embedded systems that converts the RAK2287/RAK5146 mPCIe LoRa concentrator modules into USB Type C pluggable (via the include Type C to A cable).

This new approach allows for it to be easily integrated into existing hardware like routers, industrial PC, etc., adding LoRaWAN gateway capabilities (for example turning a laptop into a testbed LoRaWAN gateway by simply plugging it in and running the software stack)

As it features fully functioning concentrators modules it is capable of working with 8 uplink and 1 downlink channels at SF7-12 (RAK2287) / SF5-12 (RAK5146).

The RAK Developer Base is an ideal solution for LPWAN deployments where integration with existing hardware is crucial, or scenarios when on the go deployment is required, for drive testing or coverage evaluation in mobile scenarios.

This device is a complete and cost-efficient LoRa gateway solution offering up to 10 programmable parallel demodulation paths.

## Product Features

- Compatible with RAK2287(SX1302) / RAK5146(SX1303) concentrator modules with 8 uplink channels and 1 downlink channel.
