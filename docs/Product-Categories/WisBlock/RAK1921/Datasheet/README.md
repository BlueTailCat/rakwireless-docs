## Specifications



### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into four parts. It discusses the interfacing, pinouts, and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical and mechanical parameters that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK1921 WisBlock OLED Display.

####  Chipset
| Vendor                  | Part number |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| Solomon Systech Limited | SSD1306     |


#### Interfaces

The RAK1921 module is compatible with the RAK5005-O WisBoard baseboard. The RAK5005-O has reserved a dedicated I2C port with a 2.54&nbsp;mm header, as shown in the red rectangle in **Figure 1**, in which the RAK1921 can be attached.
