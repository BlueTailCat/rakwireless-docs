##### Added

| No.  | Feature                   | Description                                                  |
| ---- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Gateway Setup Enhancement | When the gateway is set up in Basic Station working mode, users can skip the step of adding a single button. This feature provides more convenience for users, especially those with specific requirements who need to set up multiple gateways without manual input. During the factory setup, the individual keys are written to the gateways. When the gateways are online at the Basic Station location, WisDM will automatically retrieve the keys. This process streamlines the setup and eliminates the need for manual key entry, saving users time. |

##### Fixed

| Daily Build No. / Bug No. | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1                         | ***Oops! Something went wrong* Error in New Organization Flow** <br> Resolved the issue where users encountered the error message when clicking on the map during the New Organization flow. |
| 2                         | **Duplicate Logs in History Logs** <br> Fixed the bug where logs were duplicated when users tried to select a specific time period for history logs. It will now display accurate and non-duplicated logs when accessing the history data. |
