# RAK3172 WisDuo LPWAN Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

RAK3172 is a low-power long-range transceiver module based on the STM32WLE5CC chip. It provides an easy-to-use, small-size, low-power solution for long-range wireless data applications. This module complies with Class A, B, & C of the LoRaWAN 1.0.3 specifications. It can easily connect to different LoRaWAN server platforms like TheThingsNetwork (TTN), Chirpstack, Actility, etc. It also supports LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communication mode, which helps you implement your own customized long-range LoRa network quickly.

You can configure the mode and operation of the module using AT commands via a UART interface. RAK3172 also offers low-power features, which are very suitable for battery-powered applications.

### Hardware

The hardware specification discusses the interfaces, pinouts and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the parameters of both RAK3172 modules in terms of RF, electrical, mechanical, and operating characteristics.

#### Interfaces

| Module  | Interfaces           |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| RAK3172 | UART2/LPUART1, UART1 |

##### Sub-GHz SPI interface

A dedicated internal SPI interface called **SUBGHZSPI** is used to communicate with the RF subsystem of the **STM32WLE5CCU6**.


#### Pin Definition

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
When using `RF` pin for antenna connection and not the IPEX connector variant, make sure there is no ground plane (in all layers of the PCB) under the RF trace path to eliminate the possible effects of unwanted stray capacitance which can cause degradation of the RF signal levels.

- Ramp-down Rate (C): **1~3¬∞&nbsp;C/sec**

### Software

Download the latest RAK3172 WisDuo LPWAN Module firmware provided below. RAK3172(L) and RAK3172(H) use the same firmware and it will automatically detect the variant of the module being used.

The **bin file** contains the application code only and you need the RAK DFU Tool to upload this file to the module.

The **hex file** contains both the bootloader and the application code. You need to [use STM32CubeProgrammer to upload](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/STM32Cube-Programmer-Guide/) this.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Uploading the **`.hex`** file via STM32CubeProgrammer will erase all configured data on the device.
:::

RAK3172 uses UART2 serial pins to upload the latest firmware.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
RAK3172 should automatically go to BOOT mode when the firmware is uploaded via RAK DFU Tool or WisToolBox.

If BOOT mode is not initiated, you can manually send `AT+BOOT` command to start bootloader mode.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
There are RAK3172 devices loaded with old firmware versions which are not based on RUI3 (RAKwireless Unified Interface V3). These devices have v1.0.4 and below.

If the host microcontroller code is based on this old firmware, we have a [RAK3172 AT Command migration guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/AT-Migration-Guide/) that explain in detail the few differences between the two AT commands set.
