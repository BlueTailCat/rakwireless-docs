### Description

RAK12020 is a WisBlock Light Sensor module that extends the WisBlock system with an AMS TSL25911FN Light Sensor. It comes with a ready-to-use software library and tutorial, making it simple to build an ambient light-intensity data acquisition system.

The ambient light intensity data is interfaced via I2C. Additionally, RAK12020 can be mounted to the sensor slot of the WisBlock Base board.

### Product Features

* **Sensor specifications**
    *  Very high sensitivity light-to-digital converter

    *  I2C interface
    *  Two internal interrupt source
    *  Low power 3.0&nbsp;uA sleep state
    *  3.3&nbsp;V power supply

* **Size**
    * 10 x 10&nbsp;mm

## Specifications

### Overview

#### Mounting

**Figure 2** shows the mounting mechanism of the RAK12020 module on a [WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) board. The RAK12020 module can be mounted on the slots: **A, C, D, E & F**.

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into five parts. It shows the chipset of the module and discusses the pinouts, sensors, and the corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical and mechanical parameters, including the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK12020 WisBlock Light Sensor.

#### Chipset

| Vendor    | Part Number |
| --------- | ----------- |
| AMS       | TSL25911FN  |

#### Pin Definition

The RAK12020 WisBlock Light Sensor comprises a standard WisBlock connector. The WisBlock connector allows the RAK12020 module to be mounted to a WisBlock Base board. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 3**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Only the **I2C**-related pins, **VDD**, and **GND** are connected to this module. **INT** pin is the interrupt output.

:::

**INT** pin at **Pin 12/13** will depend on where sensor slot the module is plugged in. The table shows the compatible pins used by different sensor slots:

**INT (Interrupt Output Pin)**

| Slot A | Slot C | Slot D | Slot E | Slot F | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| IO1    | IO3    | IO5    | IO4    | IO6    |
