## Product Configuration

After burning the firmware image onto the SD Card, make sure you have inserted the SD Card into the **RAK7248 WisGate Developer D4H Gateway** and have the LoRa, and GPS Antenna connected. Refer to the guide on [how to burn the image](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/WisGate-Developer-Gateway-Firmware-Burning/).

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Before powering the Raspberry Pi 4, you should connect the LoRa, LTE (only in the Cellular variant), and the GPS antennas. Not doing so might damage the boards.

After the antennas are attached and the SD card is inserted into the Raspberry Pi, you can safely power on the gateway.
:::

### Wi-Fi AP Mode

By default, the gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode, which means you can find an SSID named **Rakwireless_XXXX** on your PC Wi-Fi Network List.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7248/quickstart/3.access-point.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="RAKwireless access point"
/>


:::tip üìù NOTE

**XXXX** is the last 2 bytes of your RAK7248‚Äôs WiFi MAC address. Connect to this Wi-Fi SSID using the password provided below. Take note of the default IP address of the gateway provided below as this will be needed in connecting via SSH. By default, the gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode, which means you can find an SSID named **Rakwireless_XXXX** on your PC Wi-Fi Network List.

- **Wi-Fi Password**: rakwireless
- **Default IP Address**: 192.168.230.1
:::

### Raspberry Pi 4 Ethernet Port

You can also connect your PC with the gateway through an Ethernet cable. By default, the IP address of the gateway‚Äôs Ethernet interface is `192.168.10.10`, so you need to set the IP address of your PC‚Äôs Ethernet to the same network segment, for example, `192.168.10.20`.

1. To do this on a Windows PC, go to **Control Panel -> Network and Internet -> Network and Sharing Center** and click **Ethernet**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7248/quickstart/4.network-sharing.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Network and sharing center"
/>

2. Click **Properties**, then slect **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7248/quickstart/5.ethernet-properties.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Ethernet properties"
/>

3. By default, the PC will obtain an IP Address automatically. Click **Option Use the following IP Address** and enter the IP address `192.168.10.20` then press **OK**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7248/quickstart/6.properties.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="TCP/IPv4 Properties"
/>

Now, you should be able to access your gateway from your PC successfully using the IP Address `192.168.10.10` through SSH.

### Log into the Gateway

#### Windows OS

SSH (Secure Shell) is typically used to log in to a remote machine and execute commands. There are a lot of free and good SSH Clients out there, namely [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), [BitVise SSH Client](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download), [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) and many more. Feel free to choose one that fits your needs, but for this guide, you will be using Putty

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7248/quickstart/7.putty.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Putty Software for SSH in Windows"
/>

- If you have connected to the gateway through Wi-Fi AP Mode, the IP Address is `192.168.230.1`
- If you have connected to the gateway through Ethernet, the IP Address is `192.168.10.10`
- It will then prompt you to enter the username and password. The default username and password are:

  - **Username**: pi
  - **Password**: raspberry

2. **Set RAK Gateway Channel Plan** - used to configure the frequency, which the gateway will operate on, and the LoRaWAN Server which the gateway will work with.
3. **Restart packet-forwarder** - used to restart the LoRa packet forwarder.
4. **Edit packet-forwarder config** - used to open the global_conf.json file, to edit LoRaWAN parameters manually.
5. **Configure WIFI** - used to configure the Wi-Fi settings in order to connect to a network.
6. **Configure LAN** - used to configure the Ethernet adapter settings.****


#### Connect through Wi-Fi

If you want to connect through Wi-Fi, it can easily be done with the Wireless capabilities of the Raspberry Pi 4 by choosing **5 Configure WIFI**. By default, the RAK7248 WisGate Developer D4H Gateway works in Wi-Fi AP Mode.

For the gateway to connect to the router, it must work in Wi-Fi Client Mode.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7248/quickstart/13.config-wifi.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Configuration options for Wi-Fi"
/>

There are 5 options to choose from in the Wi-Fi configuration menu:

1. **Enable AP Mode/Disable Client Mode** - the gateway will work in Wi-Fi Access Point Mode after rebooting while the Wi-Fi Client Mode will be disabled (this is the default mode).
2. **Enable Client Mode/Disable AP Mode** - the gateway will work in Wi-Fi Client mode after rebooting, while Wi-Fi AP Mode will be disabled.
3. **Modify SSID and pwd for AP Mode** - used to modify the SSID and password of the Wi-Fi AP. Only works if the Wi-Fi AP Mode is enabled.
4. **Add New SSID for Client** - this is used if you want to connect to a new Wi-Fi Network. Only works in Wi-Fi Client mode.
5. **Change Wi-Fi Country** - this is used to modify the Resident Country to match Wi-Fi standards.


:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

To enable Wi-Fi Client Mode, you have to disable AP Mode first.
:::

Once Wi-Fi AP Mode has been disabled by choosing **2 Enable Client Mode/Disable AP Mode**, you can now then connect to a new Wi-Fi Network by choosing **4 Add New SSID for Client**.

- Press **OK** and the success message will appear.
- After reboot, the gateway will connect to the router successfully through Ethernet.


#### Reboot

Lastly, reboot the gateway using the command shown below and put it in the command line.

```
sudo reboot
```

## Optional Configuration

The configurations in this section are only optional and situational.


### Reverting to Wi-Fi AP Mode

If you have entered either or both incorrect Wi-Fi SSID and Password in the Wi-Fi Client Mode setup for the RAK7248 WisGate Developer D4H Gateway to connect to the router, follow this set of steps to work again in Wi-Fi AP Mode and redo the setup.

- Remove the SD Card from your RAK7248 WisGate Developer D4H Gateway and insert it into your PC. Your PC should be able to detect it the same way as on the image below:\

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7248/quickstart/20.create-file.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="Creating rak_ap file to your SD Card"
/>

- Using your **Command Prompt** or **Terminal**, navigate to your SD Card and type the following command to generate the **rak_ap** file.

```
cd > rak_ap
```

- Check if the rak_ap file is created successfully. If so, re-insert the SD Card into your RAK7248 WisGate Developer D4H Gateway, and it should work again in Wi-Fi AP Mode.

### Configuring the Gateway

If you have successfully logged into your gateway using SSH, enter the following command in the command line:

```
sudo gateway-config
```

You will see the following page:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7248/quickstart/21.config-options.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Configuration options for the gateway"
/>

1. **Set pi password** - used to set/ change the password of the gateway.
2. **Set up RAK Gateway Channel Plan** - used to configure the frequency, which the gateway will operate on, and the LoRaWAN Server which the gateway will work with.
3. **Restart packet-forwarder**- used to restart the LoRa packet forwarder.
4. **Edit packet-forwarder config** - used to open the global_conf.json file, to edit LoRaWAN parameters manually.
5. **Configure WIFI** - used to configure Wi-Fi settings in order to connect to a network.
6. **Configure LAN** - used to configure the Ethernet adapter settings.

:::tip üìù NOTE

A unique ID will be generated for the gateway. This is also called gateway EUI in the figure above, and it is essential for registering the gateway with any LoRa Network Server (TTN, ChirpStack).
:::

There is yet another way to get your Gateway ID, by just entering the following command in the command line.

```
sudo gateway-version
```

When generating the ID by using the command, you will see the following:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7248/quickstart/29.frequency-changed.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Selecting the TTN channel plan"
/>


:::tip üìù NOTE
- When a Channel plan is selected, the gateway is configured to connect to the nearest cluster to the region. If new clusters are presented, the channel plans will be updated. For now, the only available clusters are:
   - eu1.cloud.thethings.network (European)
   - au1.cloud.thethings.network (Australian)
   - nam1.cloud.thethings.network (North American)
:::

- If you want to use another cluster, you can change the server address by selecting **4 Edit packet-forwarder config**.
- If you want to use TTN for the LoRa Network server, you can skip the **If the Server is ChirpStack** section and head to [registering the gateway in TTN](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7248/Supported-LoRa-Network-Servers/#connecting-with-chirpstack).

##### Server is ChirpStack

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7248/quickstart/30.chirpstack-server.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Server is ChirpStack"
/>

If you choose ChirpStack as your LoRa Server, you will see the following page with two options available:

1. **ChirpStack Channel Plan Configuration** - used to configure your Regional Frequency Band.
2. **ChirpStack ADR Configure** - used to enable/disable the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) functionality.
