#### Through Micro USB

Configuring the RAK5010-M-BG95 and checking logs via USB has the same setup. Refer to the guide on USB connection in the [checking device logs](#through-micro-usb) section.

### Connecting Cellular Network and Sending Packets over Cellular

In this section, you will learn more about how to connect to the Cellular Network of your device.

- To start with, insert a SIM card into your RAK5010-M. For this section, a China Mobile SIM card is used to have a GSM network connection.

As described in the previous section, there are three ways to configure our RAK5010-M: through UART, BLE, and micro USB. For this section, configuring the RAK5010-M-BG95 through UART is used as an example.

There are two ways to connect and send packets to Cellular Network: **Manual** and **Automatic**.

#### Manual Connection

- To begin with, send the following AT command to scan cellular networks:

```
at+scan=cellular
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 - Ensure that the LTE Antenna of the RAK5010-M-BG95 is connected properly.
 - Alternative command to `at+scan=cellular` is `at+set_config=cellular:(AT+COPS=?)`.
 - Complete the details of the BG95-M3 TCP AT commands manual can be downloaded from the [Quectel website](https://www.quectel.com/product/lpwa-bg95-cat-m1-cat-nb2-egprs-series).
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/24.jpg"
  width="70%"
  caption="Scanning for Cellular Networks"
/>

- Wait for about 30 seconds, then you will see the following output in the serial port tool the same as shown in **Figure 21**:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/25.jpg"
  width="70%"
  caption="Scanned Cellular Network shown in Serial Port"
/>

- As you can see, the RAK5010-M-BG95 has scanned around the Cellular network and shown them in the serial port tool.

To configure the operator information, the following command is used:

```
at+set_config=cellular:(AT+COPS=1,0,"CHINA MOBILE",0)
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 - The last parameter of AT+COPS command is the type of connection: 0-GSM, 8-LTE CAT-M1, 9-LTE CAT-NB1.
 - For example, if you want to connect to LTE CAT-M1, the command must be `at+set_config=cellular:(AT+COPS=1,0,"CHINA MOBILE",8**)`.
 - You can also check if your configuration is saved correctly with this command: `at+set_config=cellular:(AT+COPS?)`.
 - Complete the details of the BG95-M3 TCP AT commands manual can be downloaded from the [Quectel website](https://www.quectel.com/product/lpwa-bg95-cat-m1-cat-nb2-egprs-series).
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/26.jpg"
  width="70%"
  caption="Configuring the Operator"
/>

Now, continue to configure the network:

```
at+set_config=cellular:(AT+QICSGP=1,1,"CMCC","","",1)
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 - The third parameter of AT+QICSGP command is the APN of the cellular network. This is different per country and dependent on what cellular telecommunications company you want to connect with.
 - Complete the details of the BG95-M3 TCP AT commands manual can be downloaded from the [Quectel website](https://www.quectel.com/product/lpwa-bg95-cat-m1-cat-nb2-egprs-series).
:::

```
at+set_config=cellular:(AT+QIACT=1)
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/28.jpg"
  width="70%"
  caption="Configuring the Cellular Network"
/>

- Then, set the IP address of the server which will receive the packet sent from RAK5010.

```
at+set_config=cellular:118.31.121.60:12111:CHINA MOBILE:CMCC:CMNET:0
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 This IP address is just used for example. For your configuration, use your server IP address.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/29.jpg"
  width="70%"
  caption="Configuring the IP Address of the Server"
/>

- Next, try sending a packet manually over Cellular. Use the following command to send data over Cellular:

```
at+send=cellular:XXX
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/30.jpg"
  width="70%"
  caption="Sending Data over Cellular"
/>

- As you can see, the data sent is **123456**.

Now, check it on the receiving server:


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/muvnk5vma57gwns6apo9.jpg"
  width="75%"
  caption="Received Data shown in the terminal"
/>

```
rak2016@iZbp1980wxsue6enel4qc0Z:/home/rak2001$ tail -f rak12111
[Tue Sep 24 18:37:36 2019] [new_client] accept client [117.132.196.229:14809], new_fd:6
[Tue Sep 24 18:37:46 2019] [handle_message]: client:6 recvbuf:123456
[Tue Sep 24 18:37:47 2019] [handle_message]: client:6 disconnect.
```

As you can see in **Figure 27**, the server has received the packet successfully, and the data sent is **123456**, which is the same as the one you just sent out.

#### Automatic Connection

In this section, you will be connecting and sending data with cellular network, **automatically**.

- First, configure the parameters for the cellular operator information and the receiving server information as follows (a China Mobile SIM card based on a GSM network is used as an example):

```
at+set_config=cellular:118.31.121.60:12111:CHINA MOBILE:CMCC:CMNET:0
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/32.jpg"
  width="70%"
  caption="Configuring the Cellular Network Parameters"
/>

- Then, set the interval for sending the loop as shown in **Figure 29**.

```
at+set_config=cellular:send_interval:1:180000
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:
During sleep (LEDs are all off), you cannot send any AT command to the RAK5010-M-BG95 module. You need to restart your device and before going to sleep, you must send the command `at+set_config=cellular:send_interval:0:180000` to go back to normal mode.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/33.jpg"
  width="70%"
  caption="Setting the Loop Intervals"
/>

As you can see, the setting means that you open the sending loop and the interval time at 180 seconds. To know more details about the command, refer to the [AT Command Manual](../AT-Command-Manual/).

- Now, restart RAK5010-M-BG95 by sending the following AT command:

```
at+set_config=device:restart
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/34.jpg"
  width="70%"
  caption="Restarting your RAK5010-M"
/>

After restarting, the RAK5010-M-BG95 will automatically connect to the Cellular Network you set and send a looping packet of sensor data. Every time it sends a packet, RAK5010-M-BG95 will sleep for 180 seconds, which you just set, after which it will wake up and search for a GPS, build a new packet, and send it out.

- You will see a continuous loop as shown in **Figure 31**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/35.jpg"
  width="70%"
  caption="Continuous Loop seen in The Serial Tool"
/>

- RAK5010-M-BG95 will send sensor data automatically in a loop. You can check the data in the receiving server:

Check the data in the receiving server:

```
rak2001@iZbp1980wxsue6enel4qc0Z:~$ tail -f rak121111
[Tue Sep 24 19:18:03 2019] [new_client] accept client [221.178.125.59:14996], new_fd:6
[Tue Sep 24 19:18:17 2019] [handle_message]: client:6 recvbuf:Acc:-732.00, -178.00,620.00; Tem:27.29;Hum:46.04; Pre:964.82; Lig:3.84; Lat(0-N,1-S):0,3411.777725,Lon(0-E,1-W):0,10852.877460; Battery:3.90;
```

As you can see, the server has received the packet which RAK5010-M-BG95 sends out successfully, and they are all sensor data in the packet.

## Miscellaneous

### Bluetooth Connection Modes

There are three BLE modes in RAK5010-M-BG95 from the firmware V3.0.0.6, the **Peripheral Mode**, the **Central Mode**, and the **Beacon Scan Mode**. You can change the work mode of RAK5010-M-BG95 BLE using the command provided in the [AT Commands Manual](../AT-Command-Manual/).

```
at+set_config=ble:work_mode:X:Y
```

**Description**: Set the work mode for BLE.
- **X** - 0: BLE peripheral mode; 1: BLE central mode; 2: Beacon scan mode.
- **Y** - 0: Normal range; 1: BLE long range.

#### BLE Peripheral Mode

For the Peripheral Mode, you can scan RAK5010-M-BG95 BLE and connect with it using your mobile device.

#### BLE Central Mode

For the Central Mode, RAK5010-M-BG95 BLE will not broadcast, so that your mobile devices will not be able to scan it. This is very useful if you want to make the RAK5010-M-BG95 act as a BLE Gateway wherein BLE Sensor Nodes (up to 20 Devices) can send sensor data.

#### Beacon Scan Mode

For the Beacon Scan Mode, RAK5010-M-BG95 can scan around the Beacon signal. It is useful for Beacon use cases like iBeacon.

#### RAK5010-M BLE Default Settings

By default, the RAK5010-M-BG95 will work on **Peripheral Mode.** In this mode, you can configure it through BLE, including DFU easily. It should be noted that after resetting the RAK5010-M, you only have 60 seconds to establish a connection with your mobile device through BLE based on its power consumption settings. If no connection has been established within 60 seconds, the RAK5010-M-BG95 BLE signal will not be broadcasted, and it will enter power-saving mode. On the other hand, there is no limitation once you are already connected with the RAK5010-M-BG95 BLE.

If you set the RAK5010-M-BG95 to work in Central Mode, it will first work in Peripheral Mode for 30 seconds, and if no connection is established after 30 seconds, it will automatically work in **Central Mode.** In this mode, the BLE signal of the RAK5010-M-BG95 will stop broadcasting and will not be visible on your mobile devices until you change the work mode to Peripheral Mode or reset the RAK5010-M-BG95.

### Burning the Firmware
