## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

#### RAK11310 to WisBlock Base

The RAK11310 will not work without a WisBlock Base board. The WisBlock Base provides a USB connection to program the RAK11310. It also provides a power source and various interfaces to RAK11310, so that it can be connected to other [WisBlock Modules](https://store.rakwireless.com/pages/wisblock) via different module slots.

RAKwireless offers many [WisBlock Base Boards](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) compatible with WisBlock Core. It is highly recommended to look at these WisBlock Base boards to see what matches your requirements in terms of available module slots, power supply options, and overall size.

To illustrate, RAK11310 can be connected to the RAK5005-O WisBlock Base, as shown in **Figure 1**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak11310/quickstart/RAK5005-connect.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="RAK11310 Connection to WisBlock Base RAK5005-O"
/>

There are a few pins that are exposed on RAK5005-O, and you can easily use them via header pins. The labels are at the back, as shown in **Figure 2**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak11310/quickstart/IO-pins.png"
  width="35%"
  caption="WisBlock Base exposed pins"
/>

More information can be found on the [official documentation of the specific WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) you used in your project.

For RAK5005-O WisBlock Base with RAK11310 WisBlock Core, the accessible GPIO pins are defined as follows in the Arduino IDE and Platform IO:

- `WB_IO1` for IO1 pin
- `WB_IO2` for IO2 pin (Also used to control the 3.3V supply of some WisBlock Modules to achieve low-power IoT devices.)
- `WB_A0` for AIN

There are two usable LEDs as well that can be controlled by the RAK11310 on the WisBlock Base board:

- `LED_GREEN`
- `LED_BLUE`

UART1 and I2C_1 are also exposed on the header of the WisBlock Base board.

- RAK11310 has a native USB peripheral onboard (Serial), which is used for programming and Serial debugging, and two usable hardware **UART1** and **UART2** (Serial 1 and Serial 2). **UART1** is accessible on WisBlock Slot A, WisBlock IO slot, and the exposed header pins. **UART2** is accessible only on the WisBlock IO slot.
- The **I2C_1** header pins are shared on WisBlock Base Slots A to D as well. The second **I2C_2** is available only on the WisBlock IO slot.

#### RAK11310 to WisBlock Modules

RAK11310 WisBlock Core is designed to be interfaced with other WisBlock Modules like sensors, displays, and other interfaces. You need to connect these modules to compatible slots on the WisBlock Base.

Each WisBlock Module that will be used with RAK11310 WisBlock Core has a dedicated quick-start guide you can follow on how to connect to the WisBlock Base.

Listed are the quick-start guides of some [WisBlock modules you can buy from our store](https://store.rakwireless.com/pages/wisblock):

##### RAK11310 on Platform IO

For the Platform IO, get the examples on the [WisBlock Example code repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples) and add the necessary libraries individually. Then you can compile the example code.

#### Connecting RAK11310 to LoRaWAN

RAK11310 is the WisBlock Core capable of LoRaWAN connectivity.

There is an example on how to start with LoRaWAN in the **RAK WisBlock examples** in the Arduino IDE named `LoRaWAN_OTAA_ABP`. This is also available in the [WisBlock Repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/blob/master/examples/RAK11300/communications/LoRa/LoRaWAN/LoRaWAN_OTAA_ABP/LoRaWAN_OTAA_ABP.ino).

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak11310/quickstart/lora_solution.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="RAK11310 LoRaWAN Example"
/>

##### Configuration of LoRaWAN Example Code

There are configurations you need to set up to ensure that the device can join a LoRaWAN Network server.

The guide below will explain the default settings and how to configure them.

1. Set up the region.

Default is EU868.

```
LoRaMacRegion_t g_CurrentRegion = LORAMAC_REGION_EU868;
```

You can change this to the region applicable to you like `LORAMAC_REGION_US915`, `LORAMAC_REGION_AU915`, etc.

2. Set up the activation method.

Default is **OTAA**.

```
bool doOTAA = true;
```

To configure the device to ABP, you need to change this boolean variable to `false`.

3. Set up the message type to confirmed or unconfirmed.

Default is **confirmed message**.

```
lmh_confirm g_CurrentConfirm = LMH_CONFIRMED_MSG;
```
You can change to unconfirmed message by changing the value to `LMH_UNCONFIRMED_MSG`.

4. Set up device class.

Default is **Class A**.

```
DeviceClass_t g_CurrentClass = CLASS_A;
```

You can change this to `CLASS_B` (still under development) or `CLASS_C`.

5. Set up the keys.

If configured for OTAA activation:

```
uint8_t nodeDeviceEUI[8] = {0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x33, 0x33};
uint8_t nodeAppEUI[8] = {0xB8, 0x27, 0xEB, 0xFF, 0xFE, 0x39, 0x00, 0x00};
uint8_t nodeAppKey[16] = {0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88};
```

If configured for OTAA activation:

```
uint32_t nodeDevAddr = 0x260116F8;
uint8_t nodeNwsKey[16] = {0x7E, 0xAC, 0xE2, 0x55, 0xB8, 0xA5, 0xE2, 0x69, 0x91, 0x51, 0x96, 0x06, 0x47, 0x56, 0x9D, 0x23};
uint8_t nodeAppsKey[16] = {0xFB, 0xAC, 0xB6, 0x47, 0xF3, 0x58, 0x45, 0xC7, 0x50, 0x7D, 0xBF, 0x16, 0x8B, 0xA8, 0xC1, 0x7C};
```

6. Set up uplink period.

The default is **20000&nbsp;mS**.

```
#define LORAWAN_APP_INTERVAL 20000
```

You can make the transmission interval shorter or longer by changing this value.

##### LoRaWAN Payload

This default example will send a string `Hello!` to the LoRaWAN server. This is set up in the `void send_lora_frame(void)` function.

```
    memset(m_lora_app_data.buffer, 0, LORAWAN_APP_DATA_BUFF_SIZE);
    m_lora_app_data.port = gAppPort;
    m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = 'H';
    m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = 'e';
    m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = 'l';
    m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = 'l';
    m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = 'o';
    m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = '!';
    m_lora_app_data.buffsize = i;
```

The LoRaWAN payload is packaged in this function. You can change this section to format your payload.

##### Formatting the Payload

For illustration, you can check how the 32-bit latitude value (named `ilat`) from a GNSS sensor is formatted to a 4-byte size array.

This is the exact code snippet to format the Latitude data of the [GPS Tracker](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/blob/master/examples/RAK4630/solutions/GPS_Tracker/GPS_Tracker.ino) example.

```
    gps.f_get_position(&flat, &flon, &age);
    flat == TinyGPS::GPS_INVALID_F_ANGLE ? 0.0 : flat;
    ilat = flat * 100000;

    // longitude section...

    m_lora_app_data.port = gAppPort;
    m_lora_app_data.buffer[0] = 0x09;
    //lat data
    m_lora_app_data.buffer[1] = (ilat & 0xFF000000) >> 24;
    m_lora_app_data.buffer[2] = (ilat & 0x00FF0000) >> 16;
    m_lora_app_data.buffer[3] = (ilat & 0x0000FF00) >> 8;
    m_lora_app_data.buffer[4] =  ilat & 0x000000FF;
```

Another important part of the code is configuring the size of the payload.

This is done with the `m_lora_app_data.buffsize` variable. For illustration, with only `ilat` above as the value to send, you need to set the buffer size to five (5), because the array starts at zero (0) and ends at four (4).

```
    m_lora_app_data.buffsize = 5;
```

##### Decoding the Payload on the LoRaWAN Network Server

On the LoRaWAN network server side like TTN, Chirpstack, Helium, the value transmitted can be retrieved by decoding the payload.

```
    latitude_int = (bytes[1] << 24) | (bytes[2] << 16) | (bytes[3] << 8) | (bytes[4]);
    decoded.latitude = latitude_int / 100000;
```

##### Important Function in the LoRaWAN Example.

LoRa periodic transmission function should be very short, and all reading and processing of the data must be done in the main loop.

```
void tx_lora_periodic_handler(void)
```

Same with the transmission function, the receiving event handler should be short as well. All processing of the received data should be done in the main loop.

```
void lorawan_rx_handler(lmh_app_data_t *app_data)
```

##### Uploading the LoRaWAN Code

After all the configuration is done and the payload is formatted properly, you can now compile and upload the code. If you get errors compiling the LoRaWAN example, ensure that you have an updated BSP by checking the version in the boards manager.

  width="60%"
  caption="RAK11310 BSP(Board Support Package) in Arduino IDE Board Manager"

  width="60%"
  caption="SX126x-Arduino Library"

:::

#### LoRaWAN Configuration using AT Commands

Aside from the LoRaWAN example code in the previous section, you also have the option to configure the RAK11310 LoRaWAN parameters via AT commands.

The RAK11310 WisBlock Core is based on the RAK11300 WisDuo module, and it supports [AT commands set](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK11300-Module/AT-Command-Manual/#introduction) that will let you configure LoRaWAN-related parameters. This is very useful in scenarios where you need to deploy many devices and you want to quickly onboard devices just by sending AT commands. The AT command set is already enabled in your RAK11310 WisBlock Core, and you can use it at any time. It will only be overwritten once you upload new firmware to it.

To utilize the AT command feature in your own custom firmware, you need to include the AT command parser functions that can be found in the [RAK11300 AT command firmware repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK11300-AT-Command-Firmware).

## Miscellaneous
