### Solution Description

The Soil Moisture, Temperature, and Electrical Conductivity Solution consists of RAK Sensor Hub and RK520-02, designed for use in settings such as rice fields and greenhouse cultivation.

The sensor solution comes with a temperature compensation to ensure measurement precision and a stainless-steel probe for rapid testing when inserted into the soil surface or profile. These probes can be permanently embedded in the ground and connected to a data recorder for unlimited testing.

In addition, this solution provides a comprehensive and versatile soil condition monitoring system with Sensor Hubâ€™s form factor, allowing for the simultaneous connection of different sensors. The Sensor Hub has three isolated components: input power supply, sensing probe, and signal output. This design ensures safety, reliability, and easy installation.
