### Connect the RAK7432/RAK7434 to the Sensor

#### Power Interface Configuration

The RAK7432/RAK7434 device can be powered either by:
- DC (VIN/GND) terminals
- Micro USB

The DC screw terminals are supporting 12&nbsp;V to 24&nbsp;V. The Micro USB port can be used to power the RAK7432/RAK7434, up to 5&nbsp;V / 500&nbsp;mA DC. At the same time, the USB port is used as the configuration port for the device. You can import your configuration settings using the Micro USB cable to connect the RAK7432/RAK7434 to a computer‚Äôs USB port.

::: tip üìù NOTE
The Micro USB port can be used only for powering the device. It cannot provide power to VOUT and power other devices in the other connected 4-20&nbsp;mA/0-5&nbsp;V.

##### Configuring the Device in OTAA Mode

1. For configuring the node you will need the following three parameters: **Device EUI**, **Application EUI**, and **Application Key**. You can see them all on the **Device Overview** page, but since the two EUIs come with the device, you only need the Application Key from there.

<rk-img
src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7432-rak7434/quickstart/27.otaa-device-parameters.png"
width="100%"
caption="OTAA device parameters"
/>

2. Using the RAK Serial Port Tool, set the join mode, device class, and your LoRaWAN region to your correct frequency band, with the following set of AT commands:

- For the join mode (OTAA)

  ```
  AT+JOINMODE=OTAA
  ```

- For the class (Supported classes are: Class A, Class B, and Class C. Remember for different classes to change the command with the correct letter, for example for Class B it will be AT+CLASS=B, in this case, it is Class A.)

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

- For the region, replace the **frequency band** with the one of your LoRaWAN region. Refer to the [TTN site](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/frequency-plans/) to see more about your frequency plan.

```
AT+REGION=EU868
```

caption="Setting up the RAK7432/RAK7434 operating modes"
/>

::: tip üìù NOTE
The following tutorial is based on using the EU868 frequency band.
:::

3. Now that those parameters are set, enter the **App Key**, using the command below. Remember to replace the **"XXXX"** with the corresponding parameter value for your particular case.

```
AT+APPKEY=XXXX
```

width="100%"
caption="Receiving data in the Live data feed"
/>

##### **Configuring the Analog Interface**

Modifying the following values is not necessary but depends on the use case you need.

1. Let‚Äôs set the AINPERIOD. This value determines the acquisition reporting period. The default value is 600 s. Now we are going to set it to 100 s:

```
AT+AINPERIOD=100
```

<rk-img
src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7432-rak7434/quickstart/32.ainperiod-command-execution.png"
width="35%"
caption="AINPERIOD command execution"
/>

2. The next step is to change the value range (the minimum and maximum value) of the analog interface data.

```
AT+AINVALUERANGE=1:-150:150
```

<rk-img
src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7432-rak7434/quickstart/33.ainvaluerange-command-execution.png"
width="35%"
caption="AINVALUERANGE command execution"
/>

3. AINLPMODE (Low power mode) will also need to be changed. Enabling this value will allow the analog data input interface to be turned off while the device is in AINPERIOD (while no acquisition is initiated).

```
AT+AINLPMODE=1
```
