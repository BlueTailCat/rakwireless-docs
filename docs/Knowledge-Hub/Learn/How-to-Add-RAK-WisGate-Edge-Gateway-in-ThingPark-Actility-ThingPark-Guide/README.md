# How to Add RAK WisGate Edge Gateway in ThingPark - Actility ThingPark Guide

**ThingPark** is Actility‚Äôs platform, in which you can register your LoRaWAN gateway and end devices. ThingPark offers a user-friendly dashboard, in which you can monitor different information about the gateway/end device like status, radio traffic, statistics, and more. Together with HTTPS integration, you can send the data received from the end nodes to an Application server for post-processing and visualizing.

In this guide, you will learn how to connect a RAK WisGate Edge Gateway to the ThingPark Enterprise platform via **Basics Station**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
To connect the gateway to the ThingPark Admin console, the gateway must be updated to the latest version of WisGateOS. If the WisGateOS version is previous to 1.3.6, update to the [latest firmware](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/#LoRa/WisGateOS/). To update the gateway, refer to the [Flash Firmware section of the WisGateOS User Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Software-APIs-and-Libraries/WisGateOS/Overview/#backup-flash-firmware).
