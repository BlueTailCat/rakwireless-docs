## Product Background

**Hotspot Details**

- Efficient for mining the **Helium (HNT)** cryptocurrency
- Complete setup in minutes using a smartphone
- **LongFi technology** maximizes range and battery life without Wi-Fi, cellular, or Bluetooth
- Low Power: Only consumes about the same amount of energy as an LED light bulb (5&nbsp;W)
- Easily manage hotspots and tokens from the mobile app

**Helium LongFi** is a technology architecture that combines leading wireless technology, LoRaWAN, and the Helium Blockchain. LongFi is optimized for miles of range and long battery life for IoT devices.

![proof-of-coverage](/assets/images/wisgate/rak-hotspot/icons/proof-of-coverage.png)

RAK Hotspot earns Helium when devices connect and for validating wireless coverage delivered by peers. Using a system called Proof-of-Coverage, RAK Hotspot earns more Helium when they are in range of other RAK Hotspots, but they need to be at least 300&nbsp;meters apart.

The range depends on the environment. For rural areas, it can reach **up to 10 miles** or more, while for denser areas, it's **up to a mile**. A single RAK Hotspot earns less as it can only issue Challenges over the internet and cannot participate in Proof-of-Coverage.

- A single RAK Hotspot can deliver coverage over many square miles
- Initial testing suggests that complete city coverage can be achieved with only 50 to 100 RAK Hotspots.

![connect-anything](/assets/images/wisgate/rak-hotspot/icons/connect-anything.png)

- Establish a global network capable of connecting billions of devices
- Any IoT device can be Helium-enabled using easily accessible off-the-shelf hardware components, software, and an open-source reference design that is available for anyone to enhance.
