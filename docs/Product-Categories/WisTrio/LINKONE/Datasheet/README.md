##### Power Requirements

::: tip ð NOTE
Complete details of the battery and solar changing connections can be found on the [RAK19007 datasheet](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK19007/Datasheet/#electrical-characteristics).
:::

Link.ONE is powered by a rechargeable Li-ion battery. The nominal operating voltage of the battery should be within the range in the table:

| Min | Type | Max | Unit |
| --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
| 3.3 | 3.7  | 4.3 | V    |

The USB connector can be used as a charging port as well as via the M8 circular connector. The voltage and current fed to the battery through the port should not exceed the ones in the table below.

| Parameter        | Value                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Charging Voltage | 4.5&nbsp;V ~ 5.5&nbsp;V |
| Charging Current | 500&nbsp;mA             |

A suitable Li-ion battery should have the following parameters:

| Parameter         | Value       |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Standard Voltage  | 3.7&nbsp;V  |
| Charging Voltage  | 4.2&nbsp;V  |
| Capacity          | As required |
| Discharge Current | 2&nbsp;A    |

:::warning â ï¸ WARNING
- Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board, to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the WisBlock Base board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.
