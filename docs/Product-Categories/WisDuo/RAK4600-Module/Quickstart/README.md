### Connecting to The Things Stack (TTN V3)

This section will show how to connect the RAK4600 module to The Things Stack (TTN V3) platform.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/4.ttn-context.png"
  width="95%"
  caption="The Things Stack diagram"
/>

As shown in **Figure 13**, The Things Stack is an open-source LoRaWAN Network Server suitable for global, geo-distributed public and private deployments as well as for small, local networks. The architecture follows the LoRaWAN Network Reference Model for standards compliancy and interoperability. This project is actively maintained by [The Things Industries](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/).

LoRaWAN is a protocol for low-power wide-area networks. It allows for large-scale Internet of Things deployments where low-powered devices efficiently communicate with Internet-connected applications over long-range wireless connections.

The RAK4600 module can be part of this ecosystem as a device, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple it is to send data to The Things Stack using the LoRaWAN protocol. To achieve this, the RAK4600 module must be located inside the coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway connected to The Things Stack server.


#### Registration to TTN and Creating LoRaWAN Applications

The first step is to go to [The Things Network platform](https://console.cloud.thethings.network/) and select a cluster, as shown in **Figure 14**. The Things Industries adds more clusters from time to time, so select the one closes to your location. In this guide, Europe 1 is selected.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/t_image_1.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Selecting Cluster in TTN V3"
/>

You can use the same login credentials on the TTN V2 if you have one. If you have no account yet, you need to create one.

1. To register as a new user to TTN, click on **Login with The Things ID**, then select **register** on the next page, as shown in **Figure 15** and **Figure 16**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/t_image_2.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Login using TTN account"
/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/t_image_3.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Registration of new account"
/>

2. You should now be on the step of creating your TTN account. Fill in all the necessary details and activate your account.

3. After creating an account, log in to the platform using your username/email and password, then click **Submit**, as shown in **Figure 17**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/t_image_4.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Logging in to TTN platform"
/>

4. Click **Authorize** to proceed.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/t_image_5.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Authorization to TTN"
/>

5. Now that you are logged in to the platform, the next step is to create an application. Click **Create an application**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/t_image_6.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Creating TTN application for your LoRaWAN devices"
/>

6. To have an application registered, input first the specific details and necessary information about your application, then click **Create application**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/t_image_7.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Details of the TTN application"
/>

If you have no error on the previous step, you should now be on the application console page. The next step is to add end-devices to your The Things Stack application. LoRaWAN specification enforces that each end device has to be personalized and activated. There are two options in registering devices depending on the activation mode selected. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or Activation-By-Personalization (ABP).

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Once you have the application in The Things Stack (TTN V3), you need to ensure that you are in coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway that is registered to The Things Stack (TTN V3) as well. Without the coverage of that LoRaWAN gateway, you cannot activate any device that you will register in your application.

RAKwireless has [LoRaWAN gateways](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisgate) that you can connect to The Things Stack (TTN V3) if no LoRaWAN gateway coverage is available in your location.

:::

#### The Things Stack OTAA Device Registration

1. Go to your application console to be able to register a device. To start adding an OTAA end device, click **+ Add end device**, as shown in **Figure 21**.

After configuring all the parameters, you need to reset the RAK4600 Module to save the parameters.

7. After resetting, join in ABP mode.

```
at+join
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

By using the ABP mode in LoRaWAN, it doesn‚Äôt require to join a network before sending a LoRaWAN package. But to keep the consistency of internal states of the firmware of the RAK4600 module, it is still required to send the `at+join` command in the ABP mode. This time, the firmware should reply almost immediately with an ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.

:::

8. Try to send data from the RAK4600 to The Things Network in ABP mode.

```
at+send=lora:2:1234567890

### Connecting with ChirpStack

This section shows how to connect the RAK4600 to the ChirpStack platform. As described in the ChirpStack website:

‚ÄúThe ChirpStack open-source LoRaWAN Network Server stack provides open-source components for LoRaWAN networks. Together they form a ready-to-use solution including a user-friendly web interface for device management and APIs for integration. The modular architecture makes it possible to integrate within existing infrastructures. All components are licensed under the MIT license and can be used for commercial purposes.‚Äù

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/chirpstack-architecture.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="RAK4600 in the context of the ChirpStack platform"
/>

The architecture of the ChirpStack platform is shown in **Figure 43**. Similar to the case of TTN, the RAK4600 is located in the periphery and will transmit the data to the backend servers through a LoRa gateway. More information about this architecture can be found at [https://www.chirpstack.io/](https://www.chirpstack.io/).

* In this section, it is assumed that you are using a RAK LoRa gateway, such as RAK7243. The gateway must be configured and registered previously to ChirpStack deployment. More information can be found in the [Connect the Gateway with Chirpstack](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7243/Quickstart/#connect-the-gateway-with-chirpstack) section.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The frequency band used in this example is EU868 which is supported by the high-frequency version of RAK4600.
:::

* These are the steps needed to send data to the ChirpStack platform from a RAK4600 module:

  1. Create a new Application
  2. Register a new device on the platform
  3. Configure the Join Mode:
      * OTAA mode on the platform
      * OTAA mode on the RAK4600
      * ABP mode on the platform
      * ABP mode on the RAK4600
  4. Send data from the RAK4600 and receive it at the platform

The following section gives the details of each of these aforementioned steps. As usual, you must choose to use either ABP or OTAA mode to register the device to the network server.

#### Create a new Application

1. Go to the Application section, then click on the ‚Äú**+ CREATE**‚Äù button.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/chirpstack-applications.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application section of the RAK‚Äôs ChirpStack LoRaServer"
/>

2. ChirpStack LoraServer supports multiple system configurations, with only one by default. By default, a new Application should be created, although it is possible to reuse the existing ones. For this setup, create a new Application by clicking on the "**CREATE APPLICATION**" button.

<rk-img

7. Fill the parameters requested as appears in **Figure 50**.

* **Device name** and **Device description**: These are just descriptive texts.
* **Device EUI**: This interface allows you to generate a Device EUI automatically by clicking the icon highlighted in red in Figure 51. You can also add a specific Device EUI directly in the form.
* **Device-profile**: To join in OTAA mode, select ‚Äú**device_profile_otaa**‚Äù or ‚Äú**device_profile_abp**‚Äù to join in ABP mode.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
ChirpStack doesn‚Äôt support AS923 in ABP mode.
:::

  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/chirpstack-generate-deveui.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Generate a new Device EUI in the device registration form"
/>

#### LoRaWAN Join Mode

The LoRaWAN specification defines that to join in a LoRaWAN network, each end-device has to be personalized and activated. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or via Activation-By-Personalization (ABP). In OTAA, the end-device previously personalized is activated when deployed or reset. In ABP, personalization and activation are done as a single step.

##### OTAA Mode

###### Configure the OTAA Mode on the Platform

1. If you have selected ‚Äú**device_profile_otaa**‚Äù, then after the device is created, an Application Key must be also created for this device.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/chirpstack-otaa.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Choosing OTAA mode in the device registration form"
/>

2. A previously created Application Key can be entered here, or a new one can be generated automatically by clicking on the icon highlighted in red.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/chirpstack-otaa-appkey.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Key for the OTAA mode in the device registration form"
/>

3. Once the Application Key is added to the form, the process can be finalized by clicking on the ‚Äú**SET DEVICE-KEYS**‚Äù button.

* As shown in **Figure 54**, a new device should be listed in the  ‚Äú**DEVICES**‚Äù tab. The most important parameters, such as the **Device EUI** are shown in the summary.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/chirpstack-deveui.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="New crated device listed in the DEVICES tab"
/>

4. To end the process, it is a good practice to review that the ‚Äú**Application Key**‚Äù is properly associated with this device. The ‚Äú**Application Key**‚Äù can be verified in the ‚Äú**KEYS(OTAA)**‚Äù tab.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/chirpstack-appkey.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Key associated to the new device"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Standard OTAA mode requires the Device EUI, Application Key, and the Application EUI, but in the ChirpStack‚Äôs implementation, only Device EUI and the Application Key are mandatory. The Application EUI is not required and is not recorded in the Application tab. Nevertheless, the Application EUI is a mandatory parameter in the RAK4600 module firmware. To resolve this mismatch, you can reuse the Device EUI as the Application EUI during the configuration on the side of the node.
:::

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the RAK4600

RAK4600 complies with the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification. By default, the LoRa join mode is **OTAA** and the LoRa Class is **Class A**.

To set up the RAK4600 to join ChirpStack using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK4600 to the computer as shown in section [Interfacing with RAK4600](#interfacing-with-rak4600). Open the RAK Serial Port Tool and wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending an AT command as:

```
at+get_config=lora:status
```
or
```
at+version
```
<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/otaa-connect-rak4600.png"

### LoRa P2P Mode

This section will show how to set and link two RAK4600 units to work in LoRa P2P mode.

1. The two RAK4600 units shall be set to operate at the same frequency, for this demonstration: **EU868**.

2. As shown in the previous sections, the setup of the RAK4600 units is done by connecting them with a general-purpose computer through the UART port, as shown in section [Interfacing with RAK4600](#interfacing-with-rak4600). The setup of each RAK4600 can be done separately, but testing the LoRa P2P mode will require having both units connected simultaneously to a UART port (This could be one computer with two (2) ports or two (2) computers with one UART port each).

3. To set the RAK4600 to work in LoRa P2P mode, open the RAK Serial port tool and send the command, as shown in **Figure 69**.

```
at+set_config=lora:work_mode:1
```
<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/p2p-work-mode.png"
  width="45%"
  caption="RAK4600 setting to LoRa P2P mode"
/>

4. Configure the LoRa P2P parameters for both units. The command for setting the parameters has the following format:

```
at+set_config=lorap2p:XXX:Y:Z:A:B:C
```

* Based on the [AT Commands for RAK4600](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4600-Module/AT-Command-Manual/), the parameters are:

  * **XXX**: Frequency in Hz.
  * **Y**: Spreading factor, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
  * **Z**: Bandwidth, [0:125&nbsp;kHz, 1:250&nbsp;kHz, 2:500&nbsp;kHz]
  * **A**: Coding Rate, [1: 4/5, 2: 4/6, 3: 4/7, 4: 4/8]
  * **B**: Preamble Length, 5~65535.
  * **C**: Power in dBm, 5~20.

For this example, the LoRa parameters are:
* **Link frequency**: 869525000&nbsp;Hz
* **Spreading factor**:7
* **Bandwidth**: 125&nbsp;kHz
* **Coding Rate**:4/5
* **Preamble Length**: 5
* **Power**: 5&nbsp;dBm

5. The set parameters are translated into the following RAK4600 AT command that is sent to both units, as shown in **Figure 70**.

```
at+set_config=lorap2p:869525000:7:0:1:5:5
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/p2p-param-example.png"
  width="45%"
  caption="Setting both RAK4600 units with the LoRa P2P parameters"
/>

6. Next, set the transmission mode of the RAK4600. In this example, Unit 1 is set to sender mode, and Unit 2 is set to receiver mode by AT command.
  * **Unit 1** (Sender):
```
at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:2
```
  * **Unit 2** (Receiver):
```
at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:1
```

  caption="Set the module in the sender (left) and the receiver (right) mode"
/>

7. Now, to send a message, the string ‚Äú**123456890**‚Äù from Unit1 to Unit2. Type the command on Unit 1:

```
at+send=lorap2p:1234567890
```

* The message will be automatically received by Unit 2.

/>

### Bluetooth Interface

Starting with the firmware version V3.0.0.6, there are three BLE modes in the RAK4600 module: **Peripheral mode**, **Central mode**, and **Beacon scan mode**.

1. **Peripheral mode**: In this mode, you can scan RAK4600 BLE and connect with it using your normal mobile devices.
2. **Central mode**: The RAK4600 BLE will not broadcast so that your normal mobile devices will not be able to scan it, but it is useful for IoT use case. For example, you can connect some BLE sensor nodes to the RAK4600. By setting the RAK4600 in the central mode, the RAK4600 acts as a BLE gateway. In the central mode, "Nordic UART Service" is supported.
3. **Beacon scan mode**: The RAK4600 will scan the surrounding BLE signal. This mode is useful to scan for beacons like iBeacon near you.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
For the central and beacon scan patterns, you need to use the API development of RUI to play its role. For BLE related API interfaces, refer to [RUI API Reference](/RUI/).
:::

By default, RAK4600 BLE will work in the peripheral mode so that you can configure it over BLE, including DFU. Every time after resetting, you have only 60 seconds to connect your mobile device with RAK4600 over BLE. If you don‚Äôt connect with RAK4600 in 60 seconds after resetting it, the RAK4600 BLE radio will not broadcast to reduce power consumption. There is no limitation once your mobile device has connected with RAK4600 over BLE in 60 seconds.

Surely, you can set RAK4600 BLE to work in the central mode. After a RAK4600 module reset, there will be 30 seconds that RAK4600 BLE radio works in the peripheral mode. In peripheral mode, you can connect to RAK4600 through BLE using your mobile device and configure RAK4600 over BLE. But if you don‚Äôt connect with RAK4600 through BLE in 30 seconds, the RAK4600 BLE radio will change to central mode automatically. In central mode, RAK4600 can not be scanned by your mobile devices until you change the work mode to the peripheral or reset RAK4600 again.


## Miscellaneous

### Upgrading the Firmware

Before you start working with the RAK4600, it is recommended to keep the RAK4600 updated to the latest version of the firmware. The latest firmware can be found in the software section of the [RAK4600 Module Datasheet](../../../../../Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4600-Module/Datasheet/#firmware).

##### Upgrade Procedure

Follow this procedure to upgrade the firmware in Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) mode through the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interface.

1.  Download the latest DFU package of the [RAK4600)]https://downloads.rakwireless.com/LoRa/RAK4600/Firmware/).

2.  Install the mobile app named ‚Äú**nRF Connect**‚Äù or ‚Äú**nRF Master Control Panel (BLE)**", which are developed by the Nordic Semiconductor company.

3.  Open the Nordic mobile app and scan for the BLE signal.

4.  After resetting the RAK4600, its BLE interface should broadcast a device name with the format ‚Äú**RUI_XX:XX:XX**‚Äù for 60 seconds, as shown in **Figure 73**. Refer to the [Bluetooth Interface](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4600-Module/Quickstart/#bluetooth-interface) to know more.
