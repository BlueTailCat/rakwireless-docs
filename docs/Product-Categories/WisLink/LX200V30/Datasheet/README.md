# LX200V30 WisLink 500 Mbps Broadband PLC Module + EVB Datasheet

## Overview


### Description

LX200V30 is a new type of data transmission product based on OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing). The maximum transmission rate of power lines can reach 500 Mbps. Standard Ethernet ports, as well as the two interfaces of twisted pair and coaxial cable, are provided. The module supports 128-bit AES encryption and communicates via a frequency band of 2-68 MHz, and the existing CATV signal or wired broadcasting is not affected. It can be put into work after the wiring is completed without any user configuration. This will advance the product's time-to-market and increase the flexibility of product functionality.

### Features

- 500&nbsp;Mbps PHY rate
- 128-bit encryption
- Range:
  - Power line: up to 300&nbsp;m
  - Twisted pair: up to 600&nbsp;m
  - Coaxial cable: up to 2000&nbsp;m

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into five parts. It shows the interfacing and the pinouts of the board and their corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical and mechanical parameters of the LX200V30 WisLink 500&nbsp;Mbps Broadband PLC Module + EVB.


#### Interfaces

##### Evaluation Board (EVB)

The external interface circuits required by the LX200V30 backplane include 7 ~ 28 V, 3.3V BUCK, DC power connector, Ethernet RJ45, PLC coupling transmission transformer, and other coupling parts and their interfaces. The auxiliary interface test board is designed to be convenient for testing. When customers design products, changes will be made according to different structure of products.

:::tip üìù NOTE

1. The signals RX+ and RX-, TX+ and TX-, PERX_P and PERX_N, PETX_P and PETX_N all use differential signal lines, and the cabling should follow the rules for differential signal.
2. The width of RX+ and RX-, TX+ and TX- should be no less than 20&nbsp; mm. The length of the lines must not be more than 15&nbsp;cm.
