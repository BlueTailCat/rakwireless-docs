# RAK3244 BastWAN Breakout Board Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The **RAK3244 BastWAN Breakout Board** is specifically designed to be compatible with **Feather format** while still harnessing the power of the RAK4260 module. The board itself has the RAK4260 as its core, which is a module that utilizes ATSAMR34J18B SiP. The high level of integration allows for outstanding performance: Lora TX Power of up to 20&nbsp;dBm.

A notable addition to this breakout board is the ATECC606A **Cryptographic co-processor** with secure hardware-based key storage. This is what makes the RAK3244 BastWAN different compared to the RAK4200 and RAK4600, adding another level of security to future-proof your platform.

The board complies with LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification, and it also supports LoRa P2P Point-to-Point communication. The low power, long-range LoRa communication capabilities of the board make it suitable for a variety of applications in the IoT field such as home automation, sensor networks, building automation, and personal area networks applications such as health/fitness sensors and monitors.

##### SWD Programming Interface

When programming via a DAPLink tool, it is required to have all of the following four (4) pins connected to your DAPLink tool:

1. **3V3**
2. **SWDIO**
3. **SWCLK**
4. **GND**

::: tip üìù NOTE
For the aforementioned reason, it is best you leave these exposed for programming purposes and not to remap them as GPIOs.
:::

The proper connection between the DapLink tool and RAK3244 BastWAN Breakout Board is illustrated in **Figure 4**.

##### I2C Interface

**I2C_SCL** and **I2C_SDA** are connected to the ATECC608A crypto chip for the purpose of developing cryptographic applications: network end-point key management and exchange small message and PII data encryption, secure boot and protected download, ecosystem control, and anti-cloning. Additional I2C peripherals can be added using the breakout pins on connector J3.

##### RF Interface

The RF pin of the RAK4260 module is wired to an SMA antenna connector.
