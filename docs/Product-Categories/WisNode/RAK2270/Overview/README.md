# RAK2270 Sticker Tracker

Thank you for choosing **RAK2270 Sticker Tracker** in your awesome IoT project! ðŸŽ‰ To help you get started, we have provided you with all the necessary documentation for your product.


## Product Description

**RAK2270 Sticker Tracker** is a battery-powered LoRaWAN tracker with a label-like form factor. Itâ€™s compact; simply tear, peel, and stick RAK2270 to any product to virtually track its location in real time by leveraging the location estimator functionality of the Helium network server. It is activated using a Ri sensor, making it buttonless for ease of use.

With its built-in temperature sensor, it measures temperatures ranging from -20Â°&nbsp;C to +60Â°&nbsp;C with a temperature resolution of 0.1Â°&nbsp;C while simultaneously uploading the data to the server. It also includes an integrated 3-axis accelerometer that automatically adjusts the device positioning frequency. Because it detects whether the device is stationary or moving, it reduces device usage time.

Data, such as time, temperature, and motion state, remains safe and stored in an EEPROM storage space with a storage capacity of up to 64KB. Data can be saved locally when out of coverage and retained when coverage is restored.
RAK2270 supports various LoRaWAN bands, including IN865, EU868, AU915, US915, KR920, RU864, and AS923-1/2/3/4.
