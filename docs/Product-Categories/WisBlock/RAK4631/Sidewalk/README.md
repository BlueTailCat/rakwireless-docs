# RAK4631 Amazon Sidewalk Starter Kit

The Sidewalk Starter Kit simplifies the setup and testing of a RAKwireless device with Amazon Sidewalk. It comes with all of the necessary hardware, including a temperature and humidity sensor. There are also tools for flashing the Amazon Sidewalk firmware onto the device.

Amazon Sidewalk is a free-to-connect community network that provides secure and reliable connectivity for billions of devices. The Sidewalk Starter Kit is based on the WisBlock Core RAK4631, which incorporates the WisDuo RAK4630 Stamp Module. Furthermore, Amazon has certified the RAK4630 as a Sidewalk-compatible device, implying that it can be used to easily build Sidewalk devices.

The WisBlock modules in the kit eliminate the need for a prototype board. Just plug the modules together and power them via a USB port or another power source.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Amazon Sidewalk is only available in selected areas in the USA, including the testing or use of a Sidewalk device. Check out the coverage map at [Amazon Sidewalk Coverage.](https://coverage.sidewalk.amazon/)

### Device Setup

::: tip üìù NOTE
Flash the Sidewalk Starter Kit with the example firmware and device credentials.
:::

#### Connect the Sidewalk Starter Kit and the RAKDAP1 Device

The RAKDAP1 device is used to flash firmware and provision keys to the RAK4630 module.
The programming pins of the WisBlock RAK4631 Core module are exposed on one side. The following is the link between the RAKDAP1 and the RAK4631:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/sidewalk/rakdap1.png"
  width="65%"
  caption="RAK4630 and RAKDAP1 Connection"
/>

The WisBlock modules must be powered by a battery or via a USB connector to avoid problems during the process.

#### Install the Required Software Tools

##### Python 3 Installation

RAKDAP1 requires a Python 3 installation before it can be used. Download the latest Python 3 from the official Python website. Go to their Python Downloads page (opens a new window) and select an installer based on your system.

###### Windows

1.  Choose the Python installer for Windows.
2.  Once downloaded, start the installation process.
3.  Make sure to check the Add python.exe to PATH. Otherwise, you will have to add it manually later.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/sidewalk/python-3.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Python Installation"
/>

4.	Wait until the installation is finished.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/sidewalk/python-4.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Python Installation"
/>

5. After the installation is complete, open the command prompt window and use the following command to verify the versions of Python and pip3:

```py
python --version
pip --version
```

::: tip üìù NOTE
pip3 is required to install additional Python packages.
:::

###### macOS

Open the terminal on your Mac machine and type the following commands:

```py
ruby -e $(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"
```

::: tip üìù NOTE
If your macOS is based on Apple M chips, you might need to use this path:

```py
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH" or export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3/libexec/bin:$PATH"
```
:::

```py
brew install python
python --version
brew install libusb
```

After the installation has finished, open a command prompt window and check the versions of Python and pip3 using the following command listed below.

```py
python --version
pip --version
```

###### Linux

Open the terminal on your Linux machine and type the following command:
`sudo apt-get install python3`

After the installation has finished, open a command prompt window and check the versions of Python and pip3 using the following command listed below:

```py
python --version
pip --version
```

##### pyOCD Installation

The next step is to install pyOCD, the software tool required for flashing bootloaders and application software.

1. To start the installation, open the command prompt and use the following command:

```py
pip3 install pyocd
```

2. After the installation is finished, verify the version.

```py
pyocd --version
```

##### Support Packages Installation

To flash and debug MCU, DAPLink needs support packages. These support packages are MDK files. For more details, you can refer to the supporting list of [MDK](https://www.keil.com/dd2/Pack/).

1. To install the support package, use the following command:

```py
pyocd pack --i <PACKAGE>
```

2. For the Sidewalk Starter Kit, install the MDK for the RAK4630 module. Enter the following command:

```py
pyocd pack --i nrf52840
```

3. To check installed packages, you can use the command:

```py
pyocd pack -s
```

Before flashing a new firmware, you can also perform the erase command.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Erasing the flash memory will remove the current flashed firmware, and it will also erase the device provisioning information.
:::

```py
pyocd erase -t nrf52840 --chip
```

### Flash Example Firmware and Device Credentials with RAKDAP1

The RAK4630 in the Sidewalk Starter Kit is already flashed with the right firmware. However, it cannot connect to the Sidewalk network without the correct provisioning key that you created in the previous step.

1. To flash the provisioning key, use RAKDAP1 adapter and run the following command to flash the HEX file you created.

::: tip üìù NOTE
You must be in the directory or location where the hex files are located before proceeding with flashing. Otherwise, the process will not proceed.
:::

```py
pyocd flash -t nrf52840 YOUR_PROVISIONING_KEY.hex
```

2. Disconnect the RAKDAP1 adapter, connect a terminal application, and reset the starter kit to check if the application is starting normally.

3. If you have erased the original firmware of the RAK4630 and flashed your own custom firmware, you have to flash the provisioning key every time **AFTER** you have flashed your custom firmware.

```py
pyocd flash -t nrf52840 YOUR_CUSTOM_FIRMWARE.hex
pyocd flash -t nrf52840 YOUR_PROVISIONING_KEY.hex
```

4. After flashing the Sidewalk Starter Kit, disconnect both the kit and the RAKDAP1 tool from power and from each other.
5. Then power up the Sidewalk Starter Kit through its USB connector.

If the device is in range of an Amazon ECHO Gen4 (or another Sidewalk compatible Amazon device), it will automatically connect to Sidewalk and send the measured data of its sensor to AWS.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT
- A device profile created for prototyping through the AWS console can only be used with one device.
- A device profile created for manufacturing and linked with HSM applies to all products of that product type. However, if you have four different products (Sensor A, B, C, and D), you will need to load four different device profiles onto your HSM.
-	A provisioning key is for a single device, and each device needs its own unique key.
:::

After flashing the firmware, the device should be powered up. You can view the device log output by opening a Serial Terminal application on your computer. If you encounter error messages, it is likely due to one of the following reasons: missing provisioning key, incorrect provisioning key or device profile, or no Sidewalk device in range.
