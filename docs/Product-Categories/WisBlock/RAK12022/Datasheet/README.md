### Description

**RAK12022** is a PT100 IO module that uses **MAX31865**, an easy-to-use resistance-to-digital converter optimized for platinum resistance temperature detectors (RTDs). An external resistor sets the sensitivity for the RTD being used and a precision delta-sigma ADC converts the ratio of the RTD resistance to the reference resistance into digital form. The MAX31865‚Äôs inputs are protected against overvoltage faults as large as 45&nbsp;V. Programmable detection of RTD and cable open and short conditions is included.

### Applications

 - Industrial Equipment
 - Medical Equipment
 - Instrumentation
