- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino board, install the RAKwireless Arduino BSP. Follow the steps in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

RAK12037 is a WisBlock Sensor that extends the WisBlock system based on the SCD30 module. This module uses NDIR CO2 sensor technology to sense CO2 and has an integrated temperature and humidity sensor. Ambient humidity and temperature can be measured by monitoring and compensating for external heat sources without the need for additional components. The small module height allows easy integration into different applications. The SCD30 features dual-channel detection for superior stability and ¬±30&nbsp;ppm + 3% accuracy.

For more information about RAK12037, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

RAK12037 module can be connected to the IO slot of [WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) to communicate with the WisBlock Core, as shown in **Figure 1**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

The RAK12037 module can be mounted on the IO slot of the WisBlock Base Board, as shown in **Figure 2**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

  caption="RAK12037 mounting connection to WisBlock Base module"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock module is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak12037/quickstart/removing_screw.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

  width="70%"
  caption="Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module"

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 5**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts.
:::

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the WisBlock Base board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.

### Software Configuration and Example

#### Initial Test of the RAK12037 WisBlock Module

1. Install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index) for WisBlock by using the `package_rakwireless_index.json` board installation package. The WisBlock Core should now be available on the Arduino IDE.

2. You need to select first the WisBlock Core you have.

**RAK4631 Board**

SCD30 airSensor;

void setup()
{
  pinMode(WB_IO2, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(WB_IO2, HIGH);

	// Initialize Serial for debug output
	time_t timeout = millis();
	Serial.begin(115200);
	while (!Serial)
	{
		if ((millis() - timeout) < 5000)
		{
			delay(100);
		}
		else
		{
			break;
		}
	}

  Serial.println("SCD30 Basic Readings Example.");

  Wire.begin();

  delay(500);

  if (airSensor.begin() == false)
  {
    Serial.println("Air sensor not detected. Please check wiring. Freezing...");
		while (1)
		{
			delay(10);
		}
  }
}

void loop()
{
  if (airSensor.dataAvailable())
  {
    Serial.print("co2(ppm):");
    Serial.print(airSensor.getCO2());

    Serial.print(" temp(C):");
    Serial.print(airSensor.getTemperature(), 1);

    Serial.print(" humidity(%):");
    Serial.print(airSensor.getHumidity(), 1);

    Serial.println();
  }
  else
    Serial.println("Waiting for new data");

  delay(3000);
}
```

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you experience any error in compiling the example sketch, check the updated code for your WisBlock Core Module that can be found on the [RAK12037 WisBlock Example Code Repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/common/IO/RAK12037_CO2_SCD30) and this sample code in GitHub will work on all WisBlock Core.
:::

4. Once the example code is open, install the [SparkFun_SCD30](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_SCD30_Arduino_Library) library by clicking the yellow highlighted link, as shown in **Figure 9** and **Figure 10**.

5. After the successful installation of the library, you can now select the right serial port and upload the code, as shown in **Figure 11** and **Figure 12**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you're using the RAK11200 as your WisBlock Core, the RAK11200 requires the **Boot0** pin to be configured properly first before uploading. If not done properly, uploading the source code to RAK11200 will fail. Check the full details on the [RAK11200 Quick Start Guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK11200/Quickstart/#uploading-to-wisblock).

6. When you have successfully uploaded the example sketch, open the serial monitor of the Arduino IDE and set the baud rate correctly. You will then see the sensor's output, as shown in **Figure 13**. Therefore, your RAK12037 is properly communicating with the WisBlock core.
