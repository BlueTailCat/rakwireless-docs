# RAK Hotspot V2 Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

**Hotspot Details**

- Efficient for mining the **Helium (HNT)** cryptocurrency
- Complete setup in minutes using a smartphone
- **LongFi technology** maximizes range and battery life without Wi-Fi, cellular, or Bluetooth
- Low Power: Only consumes about the same amount of energy as an LED light bulb (5&nbsp;W)
- Easily manage hotspots and tokens from the mobile app

![longfi](/assets/images/wisgate/rak-hotspot/icons/longfi.png)

**Helium LongFi** is a technology architecture that combines leading wireless technology, LoRaWAN, and the Helium Blockchain. LongFi is optimized for miles of range and long battery life for IoT devices.

![proof-of-coverage](/assets/images/wisgate/rak-hotspot/icons/proof-of-coverage.png)

RAK Hotspot earns Helium when devices connect and for validating wireless coverage delivered by peers. Using a system called Proof-of-Coverage, RAK Hotspot earns more Helium when they are in range of other RAK Hotspots, but they need to be at least 300&nbsp;meters apart.

The range depends on the environment. For rural areas, it can reach **up to 10 miles** or more, while for denser areas, it's **up to a mile**. A single RAK Hotspot earns less as it can only issue Challenges over the internet and cannot participate in Proof-of-Coverage.

![wireless-coverage](/assets/images/wisgate/rak-hotspot/icons/wireless-coverage.png)

- A single RAK Hotspot can deliver coverage over many square miles
- Initial testing suggests that complete city coverage can be achieved with only 50 to 100 RAK Hotspots.

![connect-anything](/assets/images/wisgate/rak-hotspot/icons/connect-anything.png)

- Establish a global network capable of connecting billions of devices
- Any IoT device can be Helium-enabled using easily accessible off-the-shelf hardware components, software, and an open-source reference design that is available for anyone to enhance.

## Product Features

#### Hotspot Details

**Figure 2** summarizes the basic building blocks of the RAK Hotspot. The RAK2287 is essential to the device's functionality, providing all LoRaWAN connectivity. In addition, it sends and receives LoRa frames and handles signal modulation and demodulation.

The embedded host system, Raspberry Pi, is responsible for processing the LoRa frames and other high-level protocol-related tasks. After receiving and processing the LoRa frames, they are then sent to a LoRaWAN server.

#### Block Diagram

The RAK Hotspot serves as the central hardware solution for all LoRa-based radio communication that receives and transmits radio messages. The embedded host system, Raspberry Pi, handles the processing of the LoRa frames and other high-level protocol-related tasks. Once the radio messages are received and processed, they are sent to a LoRaWAN server.
