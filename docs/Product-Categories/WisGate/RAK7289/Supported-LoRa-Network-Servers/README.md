### Set up Your AWS Account and Permissions

If you don't have an AWS account, refer to the [AWS guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/setting-up.html). The relevant sections are **Sign up for an AWS account** and **Create a user and grant permissions**.


#### Overview

The high-level steps to get started with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN are as follows:

1. Set up Roles and Policies in IAM
2. Add a Gateway (see section [Add the Gateway to AWS IoT](#add-the-gateway-to-aws-iot))
3. Add Devices (see section [Add a LoRaWAN Device to AWS IoT](#add-a-lorawan-device-to-aws-iot))
    - Verify device and service profiles
    - Set up a Destination to which device traffic will be routed and processed by a rule.

These steps are discussed as you browse through this guide. For additional details, refer to the AWS [LoRaWAN Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan.html).

#### Add the Gateway to AWS IoT

##### Preparation

Refer to the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-onboard-gateways.html) for steps required prior to onboarding your gateway. For more details, check the software section of the [datasheet](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7289/Datasheet/#overview).

##### Frequency Band Selection and Role Setup

Refer to the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-rfregion-permissions.html) for information on selecting an appropriate frequency band.

::: tip üìù NOTE

:::


##### Add the LoRaWAN Gateway

To register the gateway with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN, follow the steps in the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-onboard-gateway-add.html) under the **Add a gateway using the console** section.

#### Add a LoRaWAN Device to AWS IoT

##### Preparation

- Go to the datasheet to learn more about the [RAK4631 WisBlock LPWAN Module](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631/Datasheet/#rak4631-wisblock-lpwan-module-datasheet).
- Follow the steps in the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-onboard-end-devices.html) under the **Before onboarding your wireless device** section, then proceed to the [**Add your wireless device to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-end-devices-add.html) section.

##### Verify Profiles

AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN supports device profiles and service profiles. Device profiles contain the communication and protocol parameter values the device needs to communicate with the network server. Service profiles describe the communication parameters the device needs to communicate with the application server.

Some pre-defined profiles are available for device and service profiles.  Before proceeding, verify that these profile settings match the devices you will be setting up to work with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN. For more details, refer to the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-define-profiles.html) under the **Add profiles to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN** section.

::: tip üìù NOTE
Proceed only if you have a device and service profile that will work for you.
:::

##### Set up a Destination for Device Traffic

Because most LoRaWAN devices don't send data to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN in a format that can be consumed by AWS services, traffic must first be sent to a Destination. A Destination represents the AWS IoT rule that processes a device's data for use by AWS services. This AWS IoT rule contains the SQL statement that selects the device's data and the topic rule actions that send the result of the SQL statement to the services that will use it.

For more information, refer to the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-create-destinations.html) under sections **Add a destination using the console** and **Create an IAM role for your destinations**. Also, refer to **Create rules to process LoRaWAN device messages** section in the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-create-destinations.html).

  caption="Changing the working mode"
/>

3. Select **Switch mode** to apply the change. After that, the **Basics Station Configuration** pane settings will show up. To connect the Gateway to TTNv3, the following parameters must be configured:

- **Server** ‚Äì For server choose **LNS Server**.
- **URI** ‚Äì This is the link to The Things Stack server. Note that, for this tutorial, we are connecting the gateway to the European cluster. For Europe fill in the following: wss://eu1.cloud.thethings.network
- **Port** ‚Äì The LNS Server uses port 8887. Type in **8887**.
- **Authentication Mode** ‚Äì Choose **TLS server authentication and Client token**. When selected, the trust and the token field will show up.
- **trust** ‚Äì For trust we will use the **Let‚Äôs Encrypt ISRG ROOT X1 Trust** certificate. The file with the certificate can be found [here](https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.pem).
- **token** -  This is the generated **API key**. The key must start with **Authorization:**. Example:

```
Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY
```

::: tip üìù NOTE
Replace **YOUR_API_KEY** with the key generated previously. Have in mind that there should be a ‚Äúspace‚Äù between **Authorization:** and **YOUR_API_KEY**, as shown in the example.
