#### Software

##### Arduino

- Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards to your Arduino Boards Manager, install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

The **RAK19015 WisBlock Battery Power Slot Module** is a power board that consists of a battery connector, a reset push button, and a power connector that can connect with the WisBlock Base board.

For more information about RAK19015, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

#### RAK19015 Supplemented by RAK5804 to Support WisBlock Core Reprogramming

Since there is no USB on RAK19015, the only way to upload the code is by using <a href="https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak5804-wisblock-interface-extension-board" target="_blank">RAK5804</a>.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling Procedure

The RAK19015 WisBlock Battery Power Slot Module can be mounted on the IO slot of the WisBlock Base board, as shown in **Figure 3**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

##### Disassembling Procedure

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock module is the same.

1. Start by removing the screws.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts.

#### Battery Connector

##### Rechargeable Battery

**RAK19015 WisBlock Battery Power Slot Module** can be powered by a rechargeable Li-Ion/LiPo battery via the dedicated connectors, as shown in **Figure 7**. The matching connector for the rechargeable battery wires is a [JST PHR-2 2&nbsp;mm pitch female](https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=199). A cable assembly for the rechargeable battery connector is also available for purchase in [RAK store](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/battery-connector-cable).

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- Improper handling of the battery can be harmful.
- 3.7 ~ 4.2&nbsp;V Li-Ion batteries are primarily supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- Make sure the battery wires, both rechargeable and non-rechargeable, match the polarity on the RAK19015 board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.

### Software Setup

The WisBlock Core is designed to be interfaced with other WisBlock Modules like sensors, displays, and other interfaces. To make useful devices, you need to upload a source code to the WisBlock Core.
Before you continue, you should have already set up either an [Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index) or
[PlatformIO](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/blob/master/PlatformIO/README.md).

#### WisBlock Examples Repository

To quickly build your IoT device with less hassle, example codes for WisBlock Core are provided. You can access the codes on the [WisBlock Example code repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples). The example codes on folder `common` are compatible with RAK4631, RAK11200, and RAK11310 WisBlock cores.
The two user LEDs of RAK19015 can be accessed using macrodefinitions `LED_GREEN` / `PIN_LED1` for the green LED and `LED_BLUE` / `PIN_LED2` for the blue LED.
