### Contributing to the RAKwireless doc site

Contributing to the **RAKwireless** documentation site requires basic knowledge of GitHub and general Git workflow. Also, there is a need to set up a working development environment.

#### 1. Setup local clone of private repository

<div style="padding-left: 30px">

Prerequisites:

- Install code editor (preferably [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) )
- Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

</div>

<ol type="A">
<li>Open terminal / command prompt</li>
<li>Change directory to your desired location (where you want to put rakwireless-docs repository)</li>
<li>Clone the repository: <code>git clone git@github.com:RAKWireless/rakwireless-docs.git</code></li>
<li>Change directory: <code>cd rakwireless-docs</code></li>
<li>Initialize modules: <code>yarn install</code></li>
<li>Run the local dev server: <code>yarn docs:dev</code></li>
</ol>

#### 2. Making content changes and pull requests

<ol type="i">
<li>Change directory to where <code>rakwireless-docs</code> folder is located</li>
<li>
From the root of the folder, make sure that the current branch is master: <code>git branch</code>

</li>
<li>
Make sure the master branch is updated: <code>git pull origin master</code>

![2](docs/.vuepress/public/assets/images/contributing/2.gif)

</li>
<li>
Branch out from master to commit some changes: <code>git checkout -b &lt;branch_name&gt;</code>

![3](docs/.vuepress/public/assets/images/contributing/3.gif)

</li>
<li>
Make some changes and commit

![4](docs/.vuepress/public/assets/images/contributing/4.gif)

</li>

![6](docs/.vuepress/public/assets/images/contributing/5.gif)

</li>
<li>
In GitHub, create a pull request and wait for your PR to be accepted and merged into the master

![7](docs/.vuepress/public/assets/images/contributing/6.gif)

üìù NOTE:  <br>
Create a detailed description of your pull request. Your PR's description must match exactly what the PR contains. Consider your PR automatically rejected if its description is not that detailed and informative.

</li>
</ol>

#### 3. Important things to remember when editing \*.md files

<ol type="A">
<li>
Basic file structure of the repository<br>

Most of the contents, lie on `docs`, like `Introduction`, `Knowledge-Hub`, `Product-Categories`, and `RUI`. Be sure to use the same naming convention for folders and markdown files.

</li>
<li>

All the images about devices are located and categorized in `docs > .vuepress > public > assets > images`. Make sure you put the images for the content here correctly.

![7](docs/.vuepress/public/assets/images/contributing/Picture23.png)

</li>
<li>

For cited images to be zoomable and adjustable, we don‚Äôt use the markdown style of inserting images (`![Image](link)`) but we use our custom component for that.<br>
The component has four (4) properties:
- **src** - the url/location of the image
- **figure-number** - optional (figure numbers for all images in a page are auto-generated) custom figure number
- **width** - custom width
- **caption** - figure caption

<br>Refer to the example below.

All the overview pages of devices (e.g. `docs/Product-Categories/WisLink/RAK2245-Pi-HAT/Overview/README.md`) have 3 basic frontmatter properties:

- **rak_img** - url/location of device image
- **rak_desc** - short description of the device, shown when the mouse is hovered over the card
- **rak_grp** - group of the device, string if it belongs to one group, array if it belongs to a group and subgroup
