### Connecting to The Things Stack (TTN V3)

This section will show how to connect the RAK4600 Breakout Board to The Things Stack (TTN V3) platform.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-breakout-board/quickstart/4.ttn-context.png"
  width="95%"
  caption="The Things Stack diagram"
/>

As shown in **Figure 13**, The Things Stack is an open-source LoRaWAN Network Server suitable for global, geo-distributed public and private deployments as well as for small, local networks. The architecture follows the LoRaWAN Network Reference Model for standards compliancy and interoperability. This project is actively maintained by [The Things Industries](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/).

LoRaWAN is a protocol for low-power wide-area networks. It allows for large-scale Internet of Things deployments where low-powered devices efficiently communicate with Internet-connected applications over long-range wireless connections.

The RAK4600 board can be part of this ecosystem as a device, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple it is to send data to The Things Stack using the LoRaWAN protocol. To achieve this, the RAK4600 must be located inside the coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway connected to The Things Stack server.


#### Registration to TTN and Creating LoRaWAN Applications

The first step is to go to [The Things Network platform](https://console.cloud.thethings.network/) and select a cluster, as shown in **Figure 14**. The Things Industries adds more clusters from time to time, so select the one closes to your location. In this guide, Europe 1 is selected.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-breakout-board/quickstart/t_image_1.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Selecting Cluster in TTN V3"
/>

You can use the same login credentials on the TTN V2 if you have one. If you have no account yet, you need to create one.

1. To register as a new user to TTN, click on **Login with The Things ID** then select **register** on the next page, as shown in **Figure 15** and **Figure 16**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-breakout-board/quickstart/t_image_2.png"

  caption="Login using TTN account"
/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-breakout-board/quickstart/t_image_3.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Registration of new account"
/>

2. You should now be on the step of creating your TTN account. Fill in all the necessary details and activate your account.

3. After creating an account, log in to the platform using your username/email and password then click **Submit**, as shown in **Figure 17**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-breakout-board/quickstart/t_image_4.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Logging in to TTN platform"
/>

4. Click **Authorize** to proceed.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-breakout-board/quickstart/t_image_5.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Authorization to TTN"
/>

5. Now that you are logged in to the platform, the next step is to create an application. Click **Create an application**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-breakout-board/quickstart/t_image_6.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Creating TTN application for your LoRaWAN devices"
/>

6. To have an application registered, input first the specific details and necessary information about your application, then click **Create application**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-breakout-board/quickstart/t_image_7.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Details of the TTN application"
/>

If you have no error on the previous step, you should now be on the application console page. The next step is to add end-devices to your The Things Stack application. LoRaWAN specification enforces that each end device has to be personalized and activated. There are two options for registering devices depending on the activation mode selected. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or Activation-By-Personalization (ABP).

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Once you have the application in The Things Stack (TTN V3), you need to ensure that you are in coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway that is registered to The Things Stack (TTN V3) as well. Without the coverage of that LoRaWAN gateway, you cannot activate any device that you will register in your application.

RAKwireless has [LoRaWAN gateways](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisgate) that you can connect to The Things Stack (TTN V3) if no LoRaWAN gateway coverage is available in your location.

### Connecting with ChirpStack

This section shows how to connect the RAK4600 Breakout Board to the ChirpStack platform. As described in the ChirpStack website:

‚ÄúChirpStack provides open-source components for LoRaWAN networks. Together they form a ready-to-use solution including a user-friendly web interface for device management and APIs for integration. The modular architecture makes it possible to integrate within existing infrastructures. All components are licensed under the MIT license and can be used for commercial purposes.‚Äù

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-breakout-board/quickstart/connecting-chirpstack/chirpstack-architecture.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="RAK4600 Breakout Board in the context of the ChirpStack platform"
/>

The architecture of the ChirpStack platform is shown in **Figure 43**. Similar to the case of TTN, the RAK4600 Breakout Board is located in the periphery and will transmit the data to the backend servers through a LoRa gateway. For a more technical understanding of the ChirpStack components, refer to its [Architecture](https://www.chirpstack.io/project/architecture/) page.


* In this section, it is assumed that you are using a RAK LoRa gateway, such as the RAK7243. The gateway must be configured and registered previously to ChirpStack deployment. More information can be found at [Connect the Gateway with Chirpstack](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7243/Quickstart/#connect-the-gateway-with-chirpstack).

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The frequency band used in this example is EU868 which is supported by the high-frequency version of the RAK4600 Breakout Board.
:::

* These are the steps needed to send data to the ChirpStack platform from a RAK4600 Breakout Board:

  1. Create a new Application
  2. Register a new device on the platform:
  3. Configure the Join Mode:
      * OTAA mode on the platform
      * OTAA mode on the RAK4600
      * ABP mode on the platform
      * ABP mode on the RAK4600 Breakout Board
  4. Send data from the RAK4600 Breakout Board and receive it at the platform

The following section gives the details of each of these aforementioned steps. Before you start, you must choose to use either ABP or OTAA mode to register the device to the network server.

  width="100%"
  caption="Generate a new Device EUI in the device registration form"
/>

#### LoRaWAN Join Mode

The LoRaWAN specification defines that to join in a LoRaWAN network, each end-device has to be personalized and activated. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or via Activation-By-Personalization (ABP). In OTAA, the end-device previously personalized is activated when is deployed or reset. In ABP, personalization and activation are done as a single step.

##### OTAA Mode

###### Configure the OTAA Mode on the Platform

1. If you have selected ‚Äú**device_profile_otaa**‚Äù, then after the device is created, an Application key must be also created for this device.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-breakout-board/quickstart/connecting-chirpstack/chirpstack-otaa.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA Activation"
/>

2. A previously created Application key can be entered here, or a new one can be generated automatically by clicking on the icon highlighted in red in **Figure 53**.

  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA Set Device Keys"
/>

3. Once the ‚Äú**Application key**‚Äù is added in the form, the process can be finalized by clicking on the ‚Äú**SET DEVICE-KEYS**‚Äù button.

* As shown in **Figure 54**, a new device should be listed in the ‚Äú**DEVICES**‚Äù tab. The most important parameters, such as the **Device EUI**, are shown in the summary.

  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA List of Device in the Device Tab"
/>

4. To end the process, it is a good practice to review that the ‚Äú**Application key**‚Äù is properly associated with this device. The ‚Äú**Application key**‚Äù can be verified in the ‚Äú**KEYS(OTAA)**‚Äù tab.

<rk-img

  width="100%"
  caption="Application Key associated to the new device"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Standard OTAA mode requires the **Device EUI**, **Application Key**, and the **Application EUI**. But in ChirpStack‚Äôs implementation, only Device EUI and the Application Key are mandatory. The Application EUI is not required and is not recorded in the Application tab. Nevertheless, the Application EUI is a mandatory parameter in the RAK4600 Breakout Board firmware. To resolve this mismatch, you can reuse the Device EUI as the Application EUI during the configuration on the side of the node.
:::

###### Configure the OTAA Mode on the RAK4600 Breakout Board

RAK4600 Breakout Board complies with the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification. By default, the LoRa join mode is **OTAA** and the LoRa Class is **Class A**.

### LoRa P2P
Refer to <a href="/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4600-Module/Quickstart/#lora-p2p-mode" target="_blank">LoRa P2P guide.</a>

## Miscellaneous

### Bluetooth Connection Modes

There are three BLE modes in the RAK4600 Breakout Board from the firmware V3.0.0.6: the **Peripheral Mode**, the **Central Mode**, and the **Beacon Scan Mode**. You can change the work mode of RAK4600 Breakout Board BLE using the AT command provided, which is defined. For further information, refer to RAK4600 Breakout Board [**AT Command Manual**](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4600-Breakout-Board/AT-Command-Manual/#bluetooth-connection-modes).

```
at+set_config=ble:work_mode:<mode>:<long_range>
```

**Description:** Set the work mode for BLE.
- **mode** - 0: BLE peripheral mode, 1: BLE central mode. 2: Beacon scan mode.
- **long_range** - 0: normal range. RAK4600 Breakout Board does not support BLE long-range.

#### BLE Peripheral Mode

Using the Peripheral Mode, you can scan RAK4600 Breakout Board BLE and connect it using your mobile device.

#### BLE Central Mode

Using the Central Mode, the RAK4600 Breakout Board BLE will not advertise, so your mobile device will not be able to scan it. This is very useful if you want to make the breakout board act as a BLE gateway wherein BLE Sensor Nodes (up to 20 devices) can send sensor data.

#### Beacon Scan Mode

Using the Beacon Scan mode, the RAK4600 Breakout Board can scan around for Beacon devices. It is useful to scan iBeacon and Eddystone.

#### RAK4600 Breakout Board BLE Default Settings

By default, the RAK4600 Breakout Board will work on **Peripheral Mode**. In this mode, you can configure it through BLE including DFU easily. It should be noted that after resetting the breakout board, you only have 60 seconds to establish a connection with your mobile device through BLE based on its power consumption settings. If no connection has been established within 60 seconds, the breakout board will stop the BLE advertising and enter power-saving mode. On the other hand, there is no limitation once you are already connected with the RAK4600 Breakout Board BLE.

If you set the RAK4600 Breakout Board to work in **Central Mode**, the RAK4600 Breakout Board will work first on **Peripheral Mode** for 30 seconds, and if no connection is established after 30 seconds, it will automatically change to **Central Mode**. In this mode, the breakout board will stop the BLE advertising and will not be visible on your mobile device up until you change the work mode to peripheral mode or reset the RAK4600 Breakout Board again.

### Upgrading the Firmware

Before you start working with the RAK4600 Breakout Board, it is recommended to keep the breakout board updated to the latest version of the firmware. The latest firmware can be found in the firmware section of the [RAK4600 Breakout Board Datasheet](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4600-Breakout-Board/Datasheet/#firmware).

In the following sections, two (2) options for flashing new firmware in a RAK4600 Breakout Board are shown: **Upgrade through DAPLink** and **Upgrade through BLE**.

#### Firmware Upgrade Through DAPLink

Refer to the [RAKDAP1 Flash and Debug Tool](/Product-Categories/Accessories/RAKDAP1-Flash-and-Debug-Tool/Overview/#rakdap1-flash-and-debug-tool) guide in the Accessories category.

#### Firmware Upgrade Through BLE
