## Storage Conditions

When the 12WA-DC Mini UPS is stored, the self-discharge rate is affected by the ambient temperature. Remove it from the RAK7268 and fully charge it if it will not be used for a long time. Then turn it off and store it in a cool, dry place.
The 12WA-DC Mini UPS should not be stored without charging for more than the time indicated below:

- Storage for 1 month: -20¬∞&nbsp;C ~ 45¬∞&nbsp;C
- Storage for 3 months: -20¬∞&nbsp;C ~ 35¬∞&nbsp;C

In addition, charge the UPS regularly (once every 3~5 months) to prevent excessive discharge. An excessive discharge will affect the battery‚Äôs performance and function. The charging time is approximately 3.5 hours, and the voltage is maintained between 11.1&nbsp;V ~ 12.6&nbsp;V.
