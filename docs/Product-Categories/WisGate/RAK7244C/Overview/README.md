rak_desc: RAK7244C is built with the RAK2245 Pi Hat stacked with the newest Raspberry Pi 4, along with the GPS module and Heat Sink, increasing its performance and thermal dissipation. The backhaul capabilities are enhanced with the additional RAK2013 Cellular Pi HAT for cellular connectivity. This allows the gateway to use its LTE modem to forward data to the Cloud.

## Product Background

The **RAK7244C WisGate Developer D4+ Gateway** is a device that consists of Raspberry Pi 4, RAK2245 Pi HAT which includes a GPS module and a Heat Sink for better performance and thermal heat dissipation management, and a RAK2013 Cellular Pi HAT and its housing is built with an aluminum casing.

For the built-in RAK2245 Pi HAT, the SX1301 chip from Semtech is used, which is a built-in LPWAN concentrator IP core, a powerful digital signal processing engine. It can receive up to 8 LoRa packets simultaneously sent with different spreading factors on different channels and is available in multiple options so it can be used for international standard bands. This unique capability allows for the implementation of innovative network architectures advantageous over other short-range systems. For the build-in RAK2013 Cellular Pi HAT, it supports optional QUECTEL BG96 / EG91 / EG95 which can support NB-IoT / CAT-M / CAT1 LTE / CAT4 LTE. It follows Raspberry Pi specifications and is easy to mount with Raspberry Pi and RAK2245 Pi HAT module.

Pilot Gateway Pro is ideal for prototyping, proof-of-concept demonstration, or evaluation. It includes a ready-to-use gateway OS that can be connected to a LoRaWan server. Also, it is developer-friendly and easy even for not-so-techy users to set up the LoRaWan system. It has to be the best value and function for connectivity to address a variety of applications like Smart Grid, Intelligent Farm, and other IoT enterprise applications.
