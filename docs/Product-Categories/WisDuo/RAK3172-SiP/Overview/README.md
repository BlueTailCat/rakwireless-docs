## Product Description

RAK3172-SiP (and RAK3172LP-SiP variant) are low-power long-range transceivers based on STM32WLE5JC SoC in a System-in-Package form factor. These two modules use different RF output paths to optimize current consumption depending on the application. RAK3172-SiP uses RFO_HP while RAK3172LP-SiP uses the RFO_LP of the STM32WL SoC transceiver.

WisDuo SiP LoRa modules provide a small-size, easy-to-use, low-power solution for long-range wireless data applications. These modules comply with Class A, B, & C of LoRaWAN 1.0.3 specifications. They can easily connect to different LoRaWAN server platforms like TheThingsNetwork (TTN), Helium, Chirpstack, Actility, etc. It also supports, LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communication mode, which helps you in implementing your own customized long-range LoRa network quickly.

You can configure the mode and operation of the RAK3172-SiP/RAK3172LP-SiP using AT commands via UART interface or create custom firmware using RUI3 API. RAK3172-SiP/RAK3172LP-SiP are very small in size and offer low-power features that are very suitable for battery-powered applications.
