# WisGateOS2 Extensions

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT
WisGateOS2 2.2 comes with significant updates that affect all extensions, downgrade flow, and others. Read the following critical points carefully:

- **Downgrading Restrictions**: Once you upgrade to WisGateOS2 2.2.x, you will not be able to revert to version 2.1.x using the standard downgrade (WebUI). Make sure to back up and secure all critical data before proceeding with the upgrade. Only through a recovery procedure will a downgrade be possible. The steps for the recovery procedure can be found here: <a href="https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/OpenWRT-Recovery-Procedure/" target="_blank">OpenWrt Recovery Procedure</a>.
- **Extension Signature Requirement**: All extensions for WisGateOS2 2.2.x will now require a signature for increased security and compatibility. Extensions that lack this signature (such as those for WisGateOS2 2.0.x/2.1.x) will not be installable on 2.2.x. This ensures that you are running the new firmware with verified and trusted extensions. On WisGateOS2 2.2.x, the Extension Gallery will automatically update installed Extensions. Some extensions, such as WireGuard, require manual installation after upgrading to WisGateOS2 2.2.x.
- **Internet Connection**: Because the new firmware and Extension gallery require a signature check, an Internet connection is required during the update.
- **Dual Firmware**: Some customers may still be using firmware version 2.1.x. Both versions will be supported, but it is critical to use the correct and corresponding extensions for each version to avoid compatibility issues. We strongly recommend upgrading to the new WisGateOS2 2.2.x version to be able to use the latest features, security, and services.

**Supported Extensions**

| Extensions                | Descriptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Remarks                                                                                                |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Breathing Light           | By using the breathing light extension you can personalize the LED light‚Äôs working modes, frequency, and color.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                        |
| Custom Logo               | The Custom Logo extension allows you to upload your logo in the Web UI. This extension is universal and it works for all gateways, supporting WisGateOS2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                        |
| Country Settings/LBT      | LBT (Listen Before Talk) means that, before transmitting, the gateway checks the availability of the channel. This is necessary because LoRaWAN is a multi-channel protocol and uses ISM Band. Anyone can use the band - a collision occurs if two or more end devices send signals simultaneously. LBT is usually governed by regulations per country. In WisGateOS2, there is a country table which includes proper configurations for all countries so you can set the country code in WisGateOS2. |                                                                                                        |
| Open/Close Port           | This extension can add or delete packet traffic management rules on the gateway through the Open/Close port extension, allowing the host IP of any (or specific) network segment to communicate with the gateway through the specified port.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                        |
| Solar Battery             | The Solar battery extension is used to display the status of the solar battery used by the gateway. The status includes the solar battery's performance, battery health status, cycle period, battery power, charging and discharging mode, and other information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The extension is compatible with **RAK7289 WisGate Edge Pro and RAK7285 WisGate Edge Ultra Gateways**. |
| Wireguard                 | WireGuard is a simple but fast VPN. It aims to be faster, simpler, and leaner than the IPsec protocol. It intends to be more performant than the well-known RAKwireless - Open VPN. Before, it was not possible to use the WireGuard protocol on the RAKwireless gateways, but that is not the case now.                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                        |
| Open VPN                  | Open VPN is a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN is created where a server is deployed that both the Gateway and any number of customer devices (PC, Phone, etc.) can connect to via a public IP address. This can be implemented using any of the backhaul connectivity options the Gateway supports (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, LTE). For the LTE backhaul, make sure that the gateway has a static public IP.                                                                                              |                                                                                                        |
| Operation and Maintenance | This is an operation and maintenance tool that features scheduled device reboot and monitoring of the 4G network status. If the 4G network connection is lost, it automatically restarts the cellular module to recover the connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | This extension is only compatible with **WisGateOS2 2.2.2 and later**.                                 |

The extensions are built to work with gateways running WisGateOS2. With new firmware update for gateway, WisGateOS2 2.2.x simplifies the installation of extensions, allowing you to select and install the required extensions in the **Extension gallery**. You can choose the installation method for extensions based on the firmware version running on the gateway. To check the gateway firmware version, head to the **Dashboard** >&nbsp;**Overview** webpage.

+ If your gateway is running firmware version WisGateOS2 2.0.x or WisGateOS2 2.1.x, follow carefully the procedure defined in <a href="https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Software-APIs-and-Libraries/WisGateOS-2-Extensions/Overview/#for-wisgateos2-2-0-x-2-1-x" target="_blank">For WisGateOS2 2.0.x/2.1.x</a>.

#### Breathing Light

The breathing light LED is located on the top cover of the WisGate Edge Lite 2 Gateways and helps to easily determine the gateway‚Äôs status visually. The breathing light extension allows you to enable or disable the breathing light on the gateway‚Äôs top cover. The default state of the LED is as in its Normal state - a slowly blinking blue light.

::: tip üìù NOTE
Breathing Light extension is available only for the WisGate Edge Lite 2 version 2 Gateways.
:::

##### Working Modes

By using the breathing light extension you can customize the LED light's operation modes, frequency, and color. There are two working modes: **All** and **Warning only**. Selecting **All** activates the LED light when your gateway is functioning correctly, while **Warning only** mode indicates any malfunctions.

If you choose Warning only mode, the LED light will only work in case of abnormal activities like Internet connection loss. In Warning only mode, you can modify the light's color, but not its frequency.

#### Country Settings/LBT

LBT (Listen Before Talk) means that, before transmitting, the gateway checks the availability of the channel. This is necessary because LoRaWAN is a multi-channel protocol and uses ISM Band. Anyone can use the band - a collision occurs if two or more end devices send signals simultaneously.

The gateway checks for empty channels and uses one of them to send downlink data. If a channel is occupied, the gateway performs a random back off. In case all of the channels are occupied, the gateway waits for a free channel and tries to send the downlink data again.

LBT is usually governed by regulations per country. In WisGateOS2 2.x, there is a country table which includes proper configurations for all countries so you can set the country code in WisGateOS2 2.x.

:::tip üìù NOTE

AS923 end-devices operating in Japan shall perform Listen Before Talk (LBT), based on ARIB STD-T108 regulations. The ARIB STD-T108 regulation is available for free and should be consulted as needed.
:::


You can switch the frequency plan in the following regions:

* AS923, KR920
* EU868, RU864, IN865
* CN470

The frequency plan will be limited to a particular region. Tx power will be limited to under the maximum.


* Downlink Tx Power
* Beacon Tx Power

#### Wireguard

WireGuard is a simple but fast VPN. It aims to be faster, simpler, and leaner than the IPsec protocol. It intends to be more performant than the well-known RAKwireless - OpenVPN. Before, it was not possible to use the WireGuard protocol on the RAKwireless Gateways, but that is not the case now.

The new WisGateOS2 now offers Extension features, where you can install and set up the WireGuard extension. In this tutorial, you will learn how to set the WireGuard client on the gateway.

This guide assumes that you have some knowledge in setting up a WireGuard server and have a WireGuard server set up. <!--If you are not familiar with the WireGuard server, you can check this link <mark><link></mark>  to learn how to set up a WireGuard server.-->

:::tip üìù NOTE
WireGuard extension can only be installed on WisGate Edge V2 Gateways, with WisGateOS2 only.

#### OpenVPN

OpenVPN is a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN is created where a server is deployed that both the Gateway and any number of customer devices (PC, Phone, etc.) can connect to via a public IP address. This is possible to implement using any of the backhaul connectivity options the Gateway supports (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, LTE). For the LTE backhaul, make sure that the gateway has a static public IP.

Thus, by connecting to the server via a remote client,  can remotely manage the gateway from any point, at any time. As mentioned above, an OpenVPN server is required. This guide shows how to set up a server in the AWS cloud.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The OpenVPN extension can only be installed on WisGate Edge V2 Gateways, operating with WisGateOS2.

#### RAK Country Settings/LBT

LBT (Listen Before Talk) means that, before transmitting, the gateway checks the availability of the channel. This is necessary because LoRaWAN is a multi-channel protocol and uses ISM Band. Anyone can use the band - a collision occurs if two or more end devices send signals simultaneously.

The gateway checks for empty channels and uses one of them to send downlink data. If a channel is occupied, the gateway performs a random back off. In case all of the channels are occupied, the gateway waits for a free channel and tries to send the downlink data again.

LBT is usually governed by regulations per country. In WisGateOS2 2.x, there is a country table which includes proper configurations for all countries so you can set the country code in WisGateOS2 2.x.

:::tip üìù NOTE

AS923 end-devices operating in Japan shall perform Listen Before Talk (LBT), based on ARIB STD-T108 regulations. The ARIB STD-T108 regulation is available for free and should be consulted as needed.
:::


You can switch the frequency plan in the following regions:

* AS923, KR920
* EU868, RU864, IN865
* CN470

The frequency plan will be limited to a particular region. Tx power will be limited to under the maximum.


* Downlink Tx Power
* Beacon Tx Power

#### RAK Wireguard

WireGuard is a simple but fast VPN. It aims to be faster, simpler, and leaner than the IPsec protocol. It intends to be more performant than the well-known RAKwireless - OpenVPN. Before, it was not possible to use the WireGuard protocol on the RAKwireless Gateways, but that is not the case now.

The new WisGateOS2 now offers Extension features, where you can install and set up the WireGuard extension. In this tutorial, you will learn how to set the WireGuard client on the gateway.

This guide assumes that you have some knowledge in setting up a WireGuard server and have a WireGuard server set up. <!--If you are not familiar with the WireGuard server, you can check this link <mark><link></mark>  to learn how to set up a WireGuard server.-->

#### RAK OpenVPN Client

OpenVPN is a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN is created where a server is deployed that both the Gateway and any number of customer devices (PC, Phone, etc.) can connect to via a public IP address. This is possible to implement using any of the backhaul connectivity options the Gateway supports (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, LTE). For the LTE backhaul, make sure that the gateway has a static public IP.

Thus, by connecting to the server via a remote client, the user can remotely manage the gateway from any point, at any time. As mentioned above, an OpenVPN server is required. This guide shows how to set up a server in the AWS cloud.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The OpenVPN extension can only be installed on WisGate Edge V2 Gateways, operating with WisGateOS2.
