5. Fix the mounting bracket to the pole.

:::tip üìù NOTE
**Precautions during mounting:**
- Check regularly to ensure that the sensor is not disturbed by other running equipment that may not fully comply with the general standards, such as radio/radar transmitters, ship engines, and motors.
- Do not mount the sensor on the same plane as any radar scanning devices, and keep a distance of at least 2&nbsp;meters between them.
- When mounting the sensor, keep it at a certain distance from the radio receiving antennas around.
- Avoid nearby structures, such as trees, utility poles, and tall buildings, which can generate an eddying flow that affects the accuracy of the ultrasonic sensor.
- When mounting the sensor on a building, the ideal mounting height should be 1.5 times the height of the building.
- When mounting the sensor on the boom of a mast, the boom needs to be on the prevailing wind side.

#### Sensor Hub + Sensor Probe IO + Micro Weather Sensor Installation

The micro weather sensor comes pre-assembled with Sensor Probe IO by default at the factory. No additional assembly is required; simply connect Sensor Probe IO and Sensor Hub.

1. Connect Sensor Probe IO with Sensor Hub via the SP11 connector.
2. Align the white dot symbol on the Sensor Probe IO SP11 connector plug with the white dot symbol on the Sensor Hub SP11 connector socket and push the plug firmly into the socket.
3. Once connected, tighten the locking nut to secure the SPI connection. The Sensor Probe IO can connect to any Sensor Hub SP11 connector port. Refer to the actual use and connect to the appropriate port, as shown in **Figure 13**.
