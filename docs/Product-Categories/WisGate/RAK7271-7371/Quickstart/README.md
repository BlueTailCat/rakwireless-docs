## Product Configuration

### Using Raspberry Pi as a Host

#### Interfacing Between the Raspberry Pi and the WisGate Developer Base

The WisGate Developer Base is a device designed for integration with desktop, mobile, and embedded systems that converts the RAK2287/RAK5146 mPCIe LoRa concentrator modules into USB Type C pluggable (via the include Type C to A cable).


::: tip üìù NOTE

It is assumed that your Raspberry Pi has already been installed with an [OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems) and has internet access. You must also have an access to it over SSH or directly to the command line interface (CLI).
:::

1. Connect the WisGate Developer Base with the included cable: Type-C end in the Developer Base and Type-A in one of the Raspberry Pi USB ports.

  caption="Powering On the Developer Base"
/>

3. You can check if the base is properly connected by running this command on the CLI:

```
lsusb
```

4. In the output, you should see a **STMicroelectronics Virtual COM Port** line. This means your RAK WisGate Developer Base is properly connoted to the Raspberry Pi.

```

### Install the Software

To be able to use the Base, the installation and configuration of the software are needed.

1. To download the software, you need to execute the following commands in the CLI:

- This command will check for the latest updates of the OS and download the Git tool that will allow downloading the software:

```
sudo apt update; sudo apt install git -y
```

* This command will download the software:

```
git clone https://github.com/RAKWireless/rak_common_for_gateway.git
```

2. Enter the created directory with:

```
cd ~/rak_common_for_gateway
```

3. Start the installation with:

```
sudo ./install.sh
```

4. You will be asked to select the model of the concentrator you are installing. For this case, you should select **9. RAK2287 USB** if you are using WisGate Developer Base **RAK7271** or **10. RAK5146 USB** if you are using WisGate Developer Base **RAK7371**.

  caption="Selecting the Concentrator Model"
/>

::: tip üìù NOTE

Have in mind that the script will also install ChirpStack‚Äîan open-source LoRaWAN Network Server stack. This will allow you to create a fully functional LoRaWAN Server locally on the Raspberry Pi.

:::

If you do not want the ChirpStack to be installed, you need to run the installation with this parameter:

```
sudo ./install.sh --chirpstack=not_install
```

5. After a few minutes, the installation will be completed.

#### Installing the Software

To be able to use the Base, an installation and configuration of the software are needed. The procedure differs slightly for the two variants of the WisGate Developer Base.

##### For RAK7271 WisGate Developer Base with RAK2287 Inside

1. Install the needed **make** and **gcc** tools with the commands:

```
sudo apt install make
```

```
sudo apt install gcc
```

2. Download the archive from the Semtech Repository:

```
wget https://github.com/Lora-net/sx1302_hal/archive/V2.0.1.tar.gz
```

3. After the download is complete, extract the files with the command:

```
tar -zxvf V2.0.1.tar.gz
```

4. Enter the created folder:

```
cd sx1302_hal-2.0.1
```

5. Do a **make** with the command:

```
sudo make
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7271-7371/quickstart/8.install-software.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Installing the Software"
/>

After the compilation has successfully finished, you need to configure the correct channel plan and set the correct `global_conf.json` file to be used from the packet forwarder.

6. Open the Packet forwarder folder with the following code:

   ```
   cd packet_forwarder
   ```

7. Then list the files and folders:

   ```
   ls -l
   ```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7271-7371/quickstart/9.listing-the-content.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Listing the Content of the Folder"
/>

8. You can see that there is a different example configuration files for different LoRaWAN bands and different types of concentrators. In this setup, you are using RAK Developer Base, which is the USB, and the EU868 band. Run this command to rename the correct file to `global_conf.json`:

```
 cp global_conf.json.sx1250.EU868.USB global_conf.json
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7271-7371/quickstart/10.after-renaming.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Listing the Content of the Folder After Renaming"
/>

9. Now, you can start the packet forwarder process, which will bridge the LoRaWAN radio part with the Network Server. Use the command:

```
sudo ./lora_pkt_fwd
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7271-7371/quickstart/11.starting-packet-forwarder.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Starting the Packet Forwarder"
/>

10. At the end of this example, you can see the concentrator's EUI. Save it somewhere as it will be needed to register your gateway in the Network Server later.

You can also check the EUI from the `chip_id` tool located in the `util_chip_id` folder. Navigate to the folder and run:

```
sudo ./chip_id -u -d /dev/ttyACM0
```
