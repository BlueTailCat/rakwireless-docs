## Product Configuration

After burning the firmware image onto the SD Card, make sure you have inserted the SD Card into the **RAK7394 WisGate Developer CM4 gateway** and have the LoRa, and GPS Antenna connected.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Before powering the device, connect the LoRa, LTE (only in the Cellular variant), and GPS antennas. Not doing so, might damage the boards.

After the antennas are attached, and the SD card is inserted in the carrier board, you can safely power the gateway on.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
RAK7394P WisGate Developer gateway supports Power-over-Ethernet. You can supply yourself with a PoE injector and power up the gateway via an Ethernet cable using a PoE injector.

### Accessing Your Gateway

In this section, several ways of accessing the gateway are provided to have different alternatives for you to choose from, depending on the availability of the requirements needed.

#### Wi-Fi AP Mode

By default, the gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode which means that you can find an SSID named **Rakwireless_XXXX** on your PC Wi-Fi Network List.

  caption="RAKwireless access point"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:
**XXXX** is the last 2&nbsp;bytes of your RAK7394‚Äôs Wi-Fi MAC address. Connect to this Wi-Fi SSID using the password provided below. Take note of the default IP address of the gateway provided below as this will be needed in connecting via SSH.
- **Wi-Fi Password**: rakwireless
- **Default IP Address**: 192.168.230.1
:::

#### RAKR314 Carrier Board Ethernet Port

You can also connect your PC and the gateway through an Ethernet cable. By default, the IP address of the gateway‚Äôs Ethernet interface is `192.168.10.10`, so you need to set the IP address of your PC‚Äôs Ethernet to the same network segment, for example, `192.168.10.20`.

1. To do this on a Windows PC, go to **Control Panel -> Network and Internet -> Network and Sharing Center** and click **Ethernet**.

2. Click **Properties**, then select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**.

3. By default, the PC will obtain an IP Address automatically. Click **Option Use the following IP Address** and enter the IP address `192.168.0.10.20`, then press **OK**.

Now, you should be able to access your gateway from your PC successfully using the IP Address `192.168.10.10` through SSH.

### Log into the Gateway

#### Windows OS

SSH (Secure Shell) is typically used to log in to a remote machine and execute commands. There are a lot of free and good SSH Clients out there, namely [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), [BitVise SSH Client](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download), [MobaXterm,](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) and many more. Feel free to choose one that fits your needs, but for this guide, you will be using Putty.

- If you have connected to the gateway through Wi-Fi AP Mode, the IP Address is `192.168.230.1`
- If you have connected to the gateway through Ethernet, the IP Address is `192.168.10.10`
- It will then prompt you to enter the username and password. The default username and password are:
  - **Username**: pi
  - **Password**: raspberry

- If you are not in root mode, enter `ssh pi@192.168.230.1` in the terminal to log in to your gateway, the default password is **raspberry**.

- If you connect your PC with the gateway through Ethernet Cable, you should enter `ssh pi@192.168.10.10`, the default password is **raspberry**.
