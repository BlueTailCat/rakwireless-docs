:::tip üìù NOTE

1. RX+ and RX-, TX+ and Tx-, PERX_P and PERX_N, PETX_P and PETX_N are all the differential available signals. Follow the differential signal rules when designing your hardware.

2. The width of RX+ and RX-, TX+ and TX- should be no less than 20&nbsp;mm. The length of the lines must not be more than 15&nbsp;cm.
