# RAK4600 Evaluation Board Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

RAK4600 Evaluation Board is designed to give you a quick start to explore the LoRa/LPWAN world. The board measures 30 x 60&nbsp;mm and supports USB power supply, 3.7&nbsp;V LiPo battery, and 5&nbsp;V solar charging.

The board itself has the RAK4600 as its core, which is a module that utilizes Nordic nRF52832 MCU and an SX1276 LoRa chip. The high level of integration allows for outstanding performance: Lora TX Power of up to 20&nbsp;dBm.

The board complies with LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification, and it also supports LoRa P2P Point-to-Point communication. The low power, long-range LoRa communication capabilities of the board make it suitable for a variety of applications in the IoT field such as home automation, sensor networks, building automation, and personal area networks applications, such as health/fitness sensors and monitors.

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into five parts. It covers the interfaces, pin definitions and their corresponding functions. Also, it includes the RF requirements, electrical and mechanical parameters of the RAK4600 Evaluation Board.

#### Interfaces

RAK4601 is the WisBlock Core CPU module used on the RAK4600 Evaluation Board. **Figure 3** shows an overview of interfaces found on the RAK4600 Evaluation Board.

##### SWD Programming Interface

When programming via the RAKDAP1 DAPLink tool, it is required to have all of the following four (4) pins connected to your DAPLink tool:

1. **3V3**
2. **SWDIO**
3. **SWCLK**
4. **GND**

::: tip üìù NOTE
For the aforementioned reason, it is best you leave these exposed for programming purposes and not to remap them as GPIOs.
:::

Use **Figure 4** as a guide to connect RAKDAP1 on the RAK4600 Evaluation Board.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
For flashing the firmware, refer to the [Flash the Firmware Using DAPLink and RAKDAP1](../Low-Level-Development/#flash-the-firmware-using-daplink-and-rakdap1) section.

##### RF Interface

The RF pins of the RAK4600 Evaluation Board are connected to external antennas through a standard iPEX antenna connector.

Use **Figure 5** and **Figure 6** as a reference to identify the antennas.

##### USB Interface

The Micro-B USB connector is compliant with the USB 2.0 specification. The pin definition of the USB interface is shown below:

| **Pin Number** | **Pin Name** | **Description**             |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| 1              | USB_VBUS     | (+5&nbsp;V) USB Bus Voltage |
| 2              | USB_DM       | USB Bus D+ positive pin     |
| 3              | USB_DP       | USB Bus D- negative pin     |

##### LEDs

- üî¥ **Red LED** - connected to the charger chip to indicate the charger status. When the battery is charging, this red LED is on. When the battery is full, this LED is weak light or off.

###### RESET Button

The reset push button is connected to the reset pin P0.21 of the RAK4600. When pushed, it resets the MCU.
