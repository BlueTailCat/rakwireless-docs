  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7289-v2/quickstart/10.lightning-protection.jpg"
  width="90%"
  caption="Full lightning protection set-up"
/>

##### Outdoor Surge Protection System

- **Antenna Grounding** - RAKwireless recommends a lightning arrestor to be installed on all the antenna N-type terminals. The arrestors have to be N-type Female to Male in order to fit the antenna and enclosure connectors. Make sure you use a 10 AWG or better wire to connect the screw terminals of the arrestors to the grounding rail mounted on the building wall (grounding bar in case of field deployment).
- **Gateway Grounding** - Additionally, it is recommended to use another 10 AWG or better grounding wire to connect the screw terminal on the bottom left side of the gateway casing to the grounding rail (bar).

:::tip üìù NOTE
No additional protection for the Ethernet cabling is required at the gateway side. There is a surge protection system built-in (GDT + Anti-surge resistor).            
:::

##### Indoor Surge Protection

For protecting the indoor equipment and circuitry connected to the gateway, it is recommended to install an Ethernet port SPD lightning arrestor. It should be positioned along the cabling connecting the gateway to the PoE injector. Make sure you connect its grounding wire terminal to an appropriate building grounding point.


:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

Should you fail to adhere to the recommendations in this document RAKwireless carries no responsibility for any damage your equipment incurs due to a lightning strike.
