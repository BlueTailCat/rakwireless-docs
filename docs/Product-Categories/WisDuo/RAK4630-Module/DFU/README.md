# Device Firmware Update

There will be situations where you need to update the firmware of your RAK4630. Additionally, there are times when you may want to reupload the firmware to ensure that everything is properly configured. Updating the firmware of RAK4630 WisDuo can be done via USB connection or wirelessly using BLE via OTA DFU (Over-the-Air Device Firmware Upgrade). These methods are discussed in this guide.

- [Firmware Update via USB](#firmware-update-via-usb)
- [Firmware Update via BLE Using OTA DFU](#firmware-update-using-ble-via-ota-dfu)

## Prerequisites

### What Do You Need?

- [nRFutil utility program](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil/releases)
- nRF Connect Mobile application
   - [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nrf-connect-for-mobile/id1054362403)
   - [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp&hl=en&gl=US)
- [DFU Distribution Package](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/RUI/RUI3/Image/RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip)
- [Latest RAK4630 FW DFU Distribution Package](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/RUI/RUI3/Image/RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip)

## Firmware Update via USB

You need to have a direct connection to the USB bus of RAK4630 before you can proceed with the update. Check the minimum schematic required in the <a href="/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4630-Module/Quickstart/#hardware-setup" target="_blank">quick start guide hardware setup section</a>. This guide covers the three most popular operating systems:

- [Windows](#windows)
- [Linux](#linux)
- [MacOS](#macos)

### Windows

1. Create a new folder in your `C:\` drive named `RAK4631-R Update`.
2. Download the [nRFutil.exe](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil/releases) and the [latest DFU Package](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/RUI/RUI3/Image/RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip). Once you downloaded both files, put them in the `RAK4631-R Update` folder you created as shown in Figure 1.

  width="70%"
  caption="nRFutil.exe and RAK4630 Latest Firmware"
/>

3. Connect the RAK4630 via USB and check if the port has been detected via Device Manager. In this guide, it is detected as COM32. The COM port number is not fixed and can vary depending on the PC. If no port is shown in Device Manager, you can try double-clicking the reset button and then check again.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4630-module/dfu/2_device_manager_port_update.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Checking COM Port via Device Manager"
/>

4. After that, send the `AT+BOOT` command to the device via Serial Terminal software. Follow the <a href="/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/DFU/#how-to-check-firmware-version-using-tera-term" target="_blank">guide on using Tera Term from RAK4631-R documentation</a>, but instead of checking the firmware version, you have to input `AT+BOOT`. You will see no reply since the module will restart, then it will be momentarily disconnected before re-establishing the connection to Tera Term.

::: tip üìù NOTE
You have to disconnect the device connection to TeraTerm/Serial Terminal software or close it so that the COM port will be free when you do the firmware update in the next step. Otherwise, you will encounter errors during the firmware update.
:::

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
**Recovery Mode**

If `AT+BOOT` is not possible to be sent to the device, you can enable DFU mode via UART2_TX pin. You need to connect UART2_TX pin to GND then reset the device to enter DFU mode. Then, proceed on the next step and upload the firmware even without the `AT+BOOT` command.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4630-module/dfu/x4_boot.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="AT+BOOT to Initialize Boot Mode"
/>

5. After initiating Boot mode, execute the firmware update. Open the command prompt and must be in `RAK4631-R Update` folder directory to do the firmware update. This is folder where you place the nRFutil and the latest firmware. You need to input `cd C:/RAK4631-R Update/` followed  by `nrfutil.exe dfu serial -pkg RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip -p COM32`. You have to ensure that you have the right `.zip` file name and `COM port number` to avoid errors.

::: tip üìù NOTE
Change the COM port number in the command based on your PC. In this example, it is COM32 but it can be different in your PC.

6. Check if the firmware is successful updated by using `AT+VER=?` command. Follow the <a href="/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/DFU/#how-to-check-firmware-version-using-tera-term" target="_blank">guide on using Tera Term from RAK4631-R documentation</a> to check the firmware version and to confirm if the device is now updated.

### Linux

#### Setup the Linux Environment

1. First, open a new terminal and install all dependencies.


```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install net-tools git curl python xclip python3-pip
```

2. Verify that you have installed `Python 3.7` or later. Check your Python version, as shown in **Figure 6**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4630-module/dfu/python-version.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Check Python version"
/>

3. Add `.local` folder to Linux `$PATH` variable.

```
export PATH="$HOME/.local:$PATH"
```

4. Install `nrfutil`. It is available as a package in the Python Package Index (PyPI). Execute the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get update
pip3 install nrfutil --user
```

#### Setup the Device Console Port in Linux

1. Install the minicom using the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install minicom
```

2. To open the minicom terminal utility with the ttyACM0 interface. The correct port name can be determined using `dmesg`, as shown in the [next steps](/Product-Categories/wisduo/rak4630-module/DFU/#execute-the-firmware-update-via-usb).

Enter the following code: `minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0`


#### Execute the Firmware Update via USB

1. Download the zip file [DFU Distribution Package](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/#RUI/V3/Image/).

When you plug in the RAK4630 through the USB to Linux, you will see the related information "**cdc_acm 1-1:1.0:  ttyACM0: USB ACM device**" from the `dmesg` command.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4630-module/dfu/dmesg-tty.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Checking USB CDC device using dmesg command"
/>

In this case, the RAK4630 **USB CDC** device name is `/dev/ttyACM0`.

2. Perform the steps described in the section [Setup the Device Console Port in Linux](#setup-the-device-console-port-in-linux).

3. On minicom, enter the following AT command:

```
AT+BOOT
```

4. Open the terminal and go to the directory where you put the DFU Distribution Package. Then, execute the following command:

`nrfutil dfu usb-serial -pkg RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip -p /dev/ttyACM0`

5. To check the device firmware version in the minicom console, enter the following AT command:

```
AT+VER=?
```

You should see then the current FW version of the module.

### MacOS

1. Download [nrfutil](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil/releases/download/v6.1.3/nrfutil-mac.1). Usually, the `nrfutil-mac.1` file will go to the downloads folder. This section assumes any downloaded file goes to the downloads folder.

2. Open the terminal and go to the downloads directory or the location where you put the downloaded file. You have to change the `username` based on your machine. In this guide, `apple` is used as the user.

```
cd /Users/username/Downloads
```

3. Make the `nrfutil-mac.1` executable.

```
chmod +x nrfutil-mac.1
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4630-module/dfu/downloads-chmod-nrfutil.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Download nrfutil for macOS"
/>

4. You also need to determine the port name of the RAK4630 using the command:

```
ls /dev/cu.*
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4630-module/dfu/rak4631-r-port.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Check the port"
/>

5. Download the [RAK4630 Firmware](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/RUI/RUI3/Image/RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip). Usually, the `RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip` file will go to the downloads folder.

6. Open a serial terminal software and run the command `AT+BOOT` to enable the bootloader mode of RAK4630.

```
AT+BOOT
```

7. Finally, execute the firmware update.

::: tip üìù NOTE
- The `nrfutil-mac.1` must be on the same folder as the `RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip`. In this guide, it is the **Downloads** folder.
- Ensure that you are connected to the correct port. The port name on your computer might be different from the one mentioned in this guide.
- It might take a while for the update. Do not remove the USB or terminate the terminal application while doing the uploading process.
:::

```
./nrfutil-mac.1 dfu usb-serial -pkg RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip -p /dev/cu.usbmodemC0D048F6604F1
```

## Firmware Update Using BLE via OTA DFU
