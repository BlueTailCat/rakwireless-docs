## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

Your **RAK4631-R** will not work on its own. It needs at least to be connected to a WisBlock Base together with the antennas attached. You can then interface various WisBlock Modules via the available slots in the WisBlock Base. You can also add a battery as a power source and optional solar charging. All hardware-related configurations for your RAK4631-R are discussed here.

This section covers:

- [RAK4631-R Connection to Base Board](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/Quickstart/#rak4631-r-to-wisblock-base)
- [RAK4631-R Connection to Other Modules](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/Quickstart/#rak4631-r-to-wisblock-modules)
- [Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/Quickstart/#assembling-and-disassembling-of-wisblock-modules)
- [Antenna and Battery/Solar Connection](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/Quickstart/#lora-and-ble-antenna)

#### RAK4631-R to WisBlock Base

The RAK4631-R will not work without a WisBlock Base board. The WisBlock Base provides a USB connection for programming the RAK4631-R. It also provides a power source and various interfaces to RAK4631 so that it can be connected to other [WisBlock Modules](https://store.rakwireless.com/pages/wisblock) via different module slots.

RAKwireless offers many [WisBlock Base Boards](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) compatible with WisBlock Core. It is highly recommended for you to look at these WisBlock Base boards to see what matches your requirements in terms of available module slots, power supply options, and overall size.

To illustrate, RAK4631-R can be connected to RAK5005-O WisBlock Base, as shown in **Figure 1**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631-r/quickstart/rak5005-connect.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="RAK4631-R connection to WisBlock Base RAK5005-O"
/>

Few pins are exposed on [RAK5005-O](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK5005-O/Datasheet/#rak5005-o-wisblock-base-board-datasheet), and you can easily use them via header pins. The labels are at the back, as shown in **Figure 2**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631-r/quickstart/IO-pins.png"
  width="35%"
  caption="WisBlock Base exposed pins"
/>

Each WisBlock Base board has its own set of header pins available for you to use. However, these header pins are not exactly the same in each WisBlock Base. It is common to see IO pins and communication protocol pins like I2C and UART in the WisBlock Base board. More information can be found on the [official documentation of the specific WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) you used in your project.

UART1 of RAK4631-R is also used for DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) via UART. If the UART1 console connection is successful, the USB serial console will not work.

There are useable LEDs as well in the WisBlock Base. You can control them in your code via the `GREEN_LED` and `BLUE_RED` macro.


#### RAK4631-R to WisBlock Modules

RAK4631-R WisBlock Core is designed to be interfaced with other [WisBlock Modules](https://store.rakwireless.com/pages/wisblock) like sensors, displays, and other interfaces. You need to connect these modules to the compatible slots on the WisBlock Base.

**Figure 3** shows an illustration on how you can combine various WisBlock Modules with the RAK4631-R WisBlock Core via the WisBlock Base board.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

**Figure 4** shows how to mount the RAK4631-R module on top of a WisBlock Base board (RAK5005-O). Follow carefully the procedure defined in [WisBlock module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to secure the connection safely. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/datasheet/mounting-sketch.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="RAK4631-R mounting sketch"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock module is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/16.removing-screws.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/17.detaching-silkscreen.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module"

/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631-r/quickstart/ble-antenna.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="BLE antenna"
/>

You need to ensure that these are properly connected to have a good LoRa and BLE signal. Also, note that you can damage the RF section of the chip if you power the module without an antenna connected to the IPEX connector.

RAK4631-R has a label on its sticker on where to connect the antennas, as shown in **Figure 10**.


<rk-img

#### For Linux

First, you need the check the compatibility with your system and choose between the 32-bit, 64-bit, and ARM versions of the Arduino IDE for Linux.

##### Installing via a tarball

1. After downloading the correct Arduino version, open a terminal, then run `ls` to check the installation file on the download folder.

2. A tarball is a type of compressed folder, like a `.zip` file, commonly used to distribute software in Linux. To extract the files from the tarball, change the directory to where the downloaded tarball is, then run:

`tar xvf arduino-version.xz`

3. When the tar command is finished, run `ls` again. A folder named  **arduino-version** will be created.

4. Change the current directory and go to the newly created folder directory. There will be a file named `install.sh` in the folder. Execute `sudo ./install.sh` to install the Arduino IDE.

The `sudo` command temporarily elevates privileges allowing the installer to complete sensitive tasks without logging in as the root user.

#### For Mac OS X

In Mac OS X, the same as Linux, there is no installation process. It is just a process of decompression, then you can open Arduino IDE successfully.

1. **IDE Option Menu**

You can configure some general parameters such as the serial port, the board information, the libraries, the edit parameters, and so on.

2. **Operating Buttons**

The operating buttons have five operations:

  - **Verify/Compile** the source code.
  - **Upload** the compiled code into WisBlock.
  - **Open** a **New** Arduino IDE window or existing application.
  - **Save** the current application.

3. **Code Area**

You can edit the source code, which will be compiled and uploaded into WisBlock later in this area.

4. **State Area**

5. **Output Message Area**
You can see the output message in this area, whether it's failure or success information.
