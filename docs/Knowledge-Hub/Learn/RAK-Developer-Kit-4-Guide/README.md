### Setting Up the Gateway

#### Configuring the RAK7246 WisGate Developer D0

This section will guide you on how to set up and configure your gateway.


:::tip üìù NOTE:
If you are new to LoRaWAN, here are a few good references about LoRaWAN and gateways:

- [LoRaWAN 101](https://news.rakwireless.com/lorawan-r-101-all-you-need-to-know/)
- [What is a LoRaWAN Gateway?](https://news.rakwireless.com/what-is-a-lorawan-gateway/)
- [How do LoRaWAN Gateways work?](https://news.rakwireless.com/how-do-lorawan-gateways-work/)
- [Things to Consider When Picking A LoRaWAN Gateway](https://news.rakwireless.com/things-to-consider-when-picking-a-lorawan-gateway/)

:::

Here are the steps in configuring the [RAK7246G WisGate Developer D0](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisgate-developer/products/rak7246-lpwan-developer-gateway?variant=36313275465886):

1. By default, the gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode, which means that you can find an SSID named **Rakwireless_XXXX** on your PC Wi-Fi network list.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/rak-developer-kit/starter-kit/rak7246g-gateway/RAK7246G-1.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="RAKwireless Access Point"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE
**XXXX** is the last 2&nbsp;bytes of your RAK7246 WiFi MAC address. Connect to this Wi-Fi SSID using the password provided below. Also, the default IP address of the gateway provided below will be needed in connecting via SSH.

- Wi-Fi Password: **rakwireless**
- Default IP Address: **192.168.230.1**
:::

2. Log into the Gateway.

  - Windows OS
     SSH (Secure Shell) is typically used to log in to a remote machine and execute commands. There are a lot of free and good SSH Clients out there, namely [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), [BitVise SSH Client](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download), [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) and many more. Feel free to choose one that fits your needs, but in this guide, Putty is used.

  width="50%"
  caption="PuTTY Example"
/>

  - Mac OS
     Open the Terminal of Mac OS. Launch the Terminal application found in the **`/Applications/Utilities/`** directory, but you can also launch it from Spotlight. Press **Command + Spacebar** and type **Terminal**, then return.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/rak-developer-kit/starter-kit/rak7246g-gateway/RAK7246G-2-b.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Selecting Terminal on Mac"
/>

3. If you have connected to the gateway through Wi-Fi AP Mode, the IP Address is **192.168.230.1**. It will then prompt you to enter the username and password. Enter the default credentials:

   - Username: **pi**
   - Password: **raspberry**

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/rak-developer-kit/starter-kit/rak7246g-gateway/RAK7246G-3.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Command Line using SSH Client Software"
/>

4. From the previous step, get the **Gateway ID** by typing `sudo gateway-config` to your chosen SSH Client terminal editor. It can be found on top of the terminal console, as shown in the red box in **Figure 5**. You may copy it on a txt file or any notepad software. It will be used in setting up the gateway in [TTN V3](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/). See **Figure 5** for reference. You will use it also as Gateway EUI in the latter part of this guide.

:::tip üìù NOTE
In this guide, you will be using TTN (The Things Network) as the LNS (LoRaWAN Network Server). There are many other LNS available that you can use, as well. The configuration steps will be different depending on your chosen LNS, but the general LoRaWAN principle is the same.

Like for [RAK WisGate Edge Gateways](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisgate-edge), it has built-in LNS that you can use.

  width="60%"
  caption="sudo gateway-config mode"
/>

5. You can now connect your gateway through Wi-Fi to access TTN. It can easily be done with the wireless capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Zero W by choosing **5 Configure WIFI**. By default, the RAK7246 WisGate Developer D0 Gateway works in Wi-Fi AP Mode. For the gateway to connect to the router, it must work in Wi-Fi Client Mode.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/rak-developer-kit/starter-kit/rak7246g-gateway/RAK7246G-5.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Configuration options for WIFI"
/>

There are 5 options to choose from in the Wi-Fi configuration menu:

   1.  **Enable AP Mode/Disable Client Mode** - the gateway will work in Wi-Fi Access Point Mode after rebooting, while the Wi-Fi Client Mode will be disabled (this is the default mode).
   2.  **Enable Client Mode/Disable AP Mode** - the gateway will work in Wi-Fi Client mode after rebooting, while Wi-FI AP Mode will be disabled.
   3.  **Modify SSID and pwd for AP Mode** - used to modify the SSID and password of the Wi-Fi AP. Only works if the Wi-Fi AP Mode is enabled.
   4.  **Add New SSID for Client** - this is used if you want to connect to a new Wi-Fi network. Only works in Wi-Fi Client mode.
   5.  **Change Wi-Fi Country** - this is used to modify the Resident Country to match Wi-Fi standards.

:::tip üìù NOTE

To enable Wi-Fi Client Mode, you have to disable first the Wi-Fi AP Mode.

:::

6. Once Wi-Fi AP Mode has been disabled by choosing **2 Enable Client Mode/Disable AP Mode**, you can now then connect to a new Wi-Fi Network by choosing **4 Add New SSID for Client**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/rak-developer-kit/starter-kit/rak7246g-gateway/RAK7246G-6.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Add New SSID for Client"
/>

- Start by selecting your country of residence.

  width="60%"
  caption="Selecting Country of Residence"
/>

- Enter the SSID of the network you want to connect.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Ensure to input the correct Wi-Fi SSID and password, or you will not be able to connect to the RAK7246 again via SSH in Wi-Fi AP Mode. If stuck in this situation, follow the [Optional Configurations](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7246G/Quickstart/#optional-configurations) procedure listed in the Accessing the Internet, which is applicable for all Raspberry Pi-based gateways to work again in Wi-Fi AP mode.

  width="60%"
  caption="Password of the Wi-Fi"
/>

- Lastly, reboot the gateway using the command sudo reboot in the command line, and it will connect to the router successfully.

```
sudo reboot
```

7. After rebooting the RAK7246 WisGate Developer D0, you should check if it is connected successfully to your Wi-Fi network. You may use your local network modem/router admin console to check if RAK7246 is successfully connected.

In this example, the admin console can be accessed via `http://192.168.0.1`. It is also common to have it on `http://192.168.1.1` on some routers. Take note of the IP address allotted to the RAK7246 by your Wi-Fi network.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/rak-developer-kit/starter-kit/rak7246g-gateway/RAK7246G-7-a.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Web UI of local modem/router"
/>


You can also use [Advance IP Scanner](https://download.advanced-ip-scanner.com/download/files/Advanced_IP_Scanner_2.5.3850.exe) for Windows OS, or [Angry IP Scanner](https://angryip.org/download/) for Mac OS, and locate the IP address of RAK7246 WisGate Developer D0 in your Wi-Fi device.

As seen in **Figure 12**, it is `192.168.0.28`, where the company is Raspberry Pi Foundation. You can use that IP address to configure other related parameters of `RAK7246 WisGate Developer D0` by logging in to the SSH Client Software, as stated in the previous step, now with the IP address of `RAK7246 WisGate Developer D0` from your Wi-Fi network.

:::tip üìù NOTE

- At this point, you can only access the RAK7246 via ssh on the allocated IP address by the Wi-Fi network. In this example, it is `192.168.0.28`.
- You cannot access anymore the RAK7246 console on its default IP `192.168.230.1`.

  width="80%"
  caption="Creating an Application"
/>

3. If you had no error during the previous step, you should now be on the application console page. The next step is to **add end-devices to your TTN application**.

LoRaWAN specification enforces that each end-device has to be personalized and activated. There are two options for registering devices depending on the activation mode you select. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or Activation-By-Personalization (ABP). You need to click **+ Add end device**, as shown in **Figure 29**.

<rk-img

  width="80%"
  caption="OTAA settings"
/>

7. Then you need to put a unique End device ID and EUIs (DevEUI and AppEUI), as shown in **Figure 33**. Check if your RAK4631 module has a **DevEUI** on **sticker or QR** that you can scan, then use this as the device unique DevEUI.

For **AppEUI**, you can click **Fill with Zeros**.
Click **Generate** for the **AppKey**. Then the End Device Name will be automatically filled by the website. You can also put a different End Device ID if you need to. Finally, click **Register End Device**.

#### Creating Environment Monitoring Application

#### Hardware Setup

This step of the guide is about the actual device configuration.

RAK1906 WisBlock Environmental Sensor module can be connected to any slot of `RAK5005-O WisBlock Base Board` to communicate with the `RAK4631 WisBlock LPWAN Module`. It will work on **SLOT A to D**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1906/quickstart/rak1906_assembly.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="RAK1906 connection to WisBlock Base"
/>

##### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

###### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 36**, the location for Slot A, B, C, and D are properly marked by silkscreen. Slots C and D are located on the bottom of WisBlock Base. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with an M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screw.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1906/quickstart/wisblock-sensor-silkscreen.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="RAK1906 connection to WisBlock Base"
/>

###### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1906/quickstart/removing-screws.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1906/quickstart/detaching-silkscreen.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module"

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK1906 uses I2C communication lines, and it can cause possible conflict especially on some IO modules.
:::

##### LoRa and BLE Antenna

Another important part component of RAK4631 is the antennas.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
When using the LoRa or Bluetooth Low Energy transceivers, make sure that an antenna is always connected. Using these transceivers without an antenna can damage the system. Make sure to fix the module with the screws to ensure a proper function.
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/lora-antenna.png"

/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/ble-antenna.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="BLE Antenna"
/>

You need to ensure that the antenna is properly connected to have a good LoRa signal. Do not power the module without an antenna connected to the IPEX connector to avoid damage to the RF section of the chip.

RAK4631 has a label on its sticker where to connect the antennas, as shown in **Figure 43**.


<rk-img

:::tip üìù NOTE
Detailed information about the RAK4631 BLE and LoRa antenna can be found on the [antenna datasheet](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/#LoRa/WisBlock/Accessories/).
:::

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming the RAK1906.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- Battery can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the RAK WisBlock Base Board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
:::

#### Software Setup

The RAK1906 is a 4-in-1 Environmental Sensor board that contains the Bosch BME680 chip. It is specially designed for wearables where size and low power consumption are critical requirements. The BME680 contains a small Metal-Oxide (MOX) sensor and an I2C interface used to communicate with WisBlock Core.

The RAK1906 module gives information about:
- Air pressure
- Air quality
- Ambient Air Temperature
- Environment Humidity

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
The BME680 requires a burn-in period to collect accurate readings. The burn-in procedure can be achieved by reading all sensors once every 5&nbsp;seconds for at least 20&nbsp;minutes the first time that you use it. For each subsequent use, the readings should stabilize 2-3&nbsp;minutes after power-up.
:::

##### Software Configuration

1. Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), then install it on your PC or laptop.

##### Configuring LoRaWAN

Before uploading the Arduino Code, there are configurations that you need to set up to ensure that the device can join a LoRaWAN Network server.

The steps below will explain the default settings and how to configure them.

1. Set up the LoRa Region.

Default region is **EU868**.

```c
LoRaMacRegion_t g_CurrentRegion = LORAMAC_REGION_EU868;
```

You can change this to a region that is applicable to you like `LORAMAC_REGION_US915`, `LORAMAC_REGION_AU915`, etc.

2. Set up the LoRaWAN activation method.

Default is **OTAA**.

```c
bool doOTAA = true;
```

To configure the device to ABP, you need to make this boolean variable `false`.

3. Set up the message type if confirmed or not.

Default is **confirmed message**.

```c
lmh_confirm g_CurrentConfirm = LMH_CONFIRMED_MSG;
```

You can change to unconfirmed message by changing the value to `LMH_UNCONFIRMED_MSG`.

4. Set up device class.

Default is **Class A**.

```c
DeviceClass_t g_CurrentClass = CLASS_A;
```

You can change this to **CLASS_B** (still under development) or **CLASS_C**.

5. Set up the EUIs and KEY. Get these parameters from the [Connecting RAK4631 to TTN V3 Application](/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK-Developer-Kit-4-Guide/#connecting-rak4631-to-ttn-v3-application) section of this guide.

It is very important that the EUI and KEY will match the one configured in the TTN application. Otherwise, your device will not be able to connect to the TTN server. In this application, the device is activated via OTAA so you need to configure the Device EUI, Application EUI, and Application Key.

```c
uint8_t nodeDeviceEUI[8] = {0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x33, 0x33};
uint8_t nodeAppEUI[8] = {0xB8, 0x27, 0xEB, 0xFF, 0xFE, 0x39, 0x00, 0x00};
uint8_t nodeAppKey[16] = {0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88};
```

6. Set up uplink period.

The default is **20000&nbsp;mS**.

```c
#define LORAWAN_APP_INTERVAL 20000
```


##### LoRaWAN Payload

- This is the setup on the `void send_lora_frame(void)` function.

```c
if (lmh_join_status_get() != LMH_SET)
{
 //Not joined, try again later
 return;
}
if (!bme.performReading()) {
 return;
}
bme680_get();

lmh_error_status error = lmh_send(&m_lora_app_data, g_CurrentConfirm);
if (error == LMH_SUCCESS)
{
 count++;
 Serial.printf("lmh_send ok count %d\n", count);
}
else
{
 count_fail++;
 Serial.printf("lmh_send fail count %d\n", count_fail);
}
```

<br>

- This is the setup on the `void bme680_get()` function. This will gather the data from the sensor and package them in a LoRaWAN payload.

```c
char oled_data[32] = {0};
Serial.print("result: ");
uint32_t i = 0;
memset(m_lora_app_data.buffer, 0, LORAWAN_APP_DATA_BUFF_SIZE);
m_lora_app_data.port = gAppPort;

double temp = bme.temperature;
double pres = bme.pressure / 100.0;
double hum = bme.humidity;
uint32_t gas = bme.gas_resistance;

data = "Tem:" + String(temp) + "C " + "Hum:" + String(hum) + "% " + "Pres:" + String(pres) + "KPa " + "Gas:" + String(gas) + "Ohms";
Serial.println(data);

// display bme680 sensor data on OLED
u8g2.clearBuffer();         // clear the internal memory
u8g2.setFont(u8g2_font_ncenB10_tr); // choose a suitable font

memset(oled_data, 0, sizeof(oled_data));
sprintf(oled_data, "T=%.2fC", temp);
u8g2.drawStr(3, 15, oled_data);

memset(oled_data, 0, sizeof(oled_data));
snprintf(oled_data, 64, "RH=%.2f%%", hum);
u8g2.drawStr(3, 30, oled_data);

memset(oled_data, 0, sizeof(oled_data));
sprintf(oled_data, "P=%.2fhPa", pres);
u8g2.drawStr(3, 45, oled_data);

memset(oled_data, 0, sizeof(oled_data));
sprintf(oled_data, "G=%dOhms", gas);
u8g2.drawStr(3, 60, oled_data);

u8g2.sendBuffer(); // transfer internal memory to the display

uint16_t t = temp * 100;
uint16_t h = hum * 100;
uint32_t pre = pres * 100;

//result: T=28.25C, RH=50.00%, P=958.57hPa, G=100406 Ohms
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = 0x01;
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)(t >> 8);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)t;
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)(h >> 8);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)h;
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((pre & 0xFF000000) >> 24);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((pre & 0x00FF0000) >> 16);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((pre & 0x0000FF00) >> 8);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)(pre & 0x000000FF);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((gas & 0xFF000000) >> 24);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((gas & 0x00FF0000) >> 16);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((gas & 0x0000FF00) >> 8);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)(gas & 0x000000FF);
m_lora_app_data.buffsize = i;
```


##### Data Format

12. Ubidots `The Things Stack` default decoder supports the payload format of RAK1906, so there is no need for further decoder configuration. This is the section of the Ubidots decoder that gets the sensor values. Since this decoder is already in Ubidots, no extra decoder is needed in the TTN application console.

```js
function decodeUplink(bytes) {
  // Decoder for the RAK1906 WisBlock Environmental Sensor (https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak1906-bme680-environment-sensor)
  var decoded = {};
  if (bytes[0] == 1) {
      // If received data is of Environment Monitoring type
      decoded.temperature = (bytes[1] << 8 | (bytes[2])) / 100;
      decoded.humidity = (bytes[3] << 8 | (bytes[4])) / 100;
      decoded.pressure = (bytes[8] | (bytes[7] << 8) | (bytes[6] << 16) | (bytes[5] << 24)) / 100;
      decoded.gas = bytes[12] | (bytes[11] << 8) | (bytes[10] << 16) | (bytes[9] << 24);
  }
  return {"data": decoded};
}
```

13. Go back to The Things Stack account and select **Go to applications**.
