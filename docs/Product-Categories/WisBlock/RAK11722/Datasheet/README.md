# RAK11722 WisBlock LPWAN Module Datasheet


## Overview

### Description

The RAK11722 WisBlock Core module is a RAK11720 stamp module with an expansion PCB and connectors compatible with WisBlock Base. It allows an easy way to access the pins of the RAK11720 module to simplify development and testing processes.

The module itself comprises a RAK11720 as its main component. The RAK11720 is a combination of an Ambiq Apollo3 Blue AMA3B1KK-KBR-B0 SoC MCU and an SX1262 LoRa chip. It features ultra-low power consumption of 2.37&nbsp;uA during sleep mode and high LoRa output power up to 22&nbsp;dBm during a transmission mode

Also, it complies with LoRaWAN 1.0.3 protocols and supports LoRa point-to-point communication. The RF communication characteristic of the module (LoRa + BLE) makes it suitable for a variety of applications in the IoT field, such as home automation, sensor networks, building automation, and personal area network applications (health/fitness sensors, monitors, etc.).
