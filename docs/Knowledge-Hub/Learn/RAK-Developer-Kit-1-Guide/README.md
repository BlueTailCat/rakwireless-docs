# RAK Developer Kit 1 (Entry Kit) Guide

## Overview

This guide is about learning how to set up a complete LoRaWAN application from device, gateway up to network server. It composes of the following sections:

- [Setting Up the Gateway](/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK-Developer-Kit-1-Guide/#setting-up-the-gateway)
- [Setting Up the Network Server](/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK-Developer-Kit-1-Guide/#setting-up-the-network-server)
- [Setting Up the Device](/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK-Developer-Kit-1-Guide/#setting-up-the-device)


### Setting Up the Gateway

#### Configuring the RAK7246 WisGate Developer D0

This section will guide you on how to set up and configure your gateway.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
If you are new to LoRaWAN, here are a few good references about LoRaWAN and gateways:

- [LoRaWAN 101](https://news.rakwireless.com/lorawan-r-101-all-you-need-to-know/)
- [What is a LoRaWAN Gateway?](https://news.rakwireless.com/what-is-a-lorawan-gateway/)
- [How do LoRaWAN Gateways work?](https://news.rakwireless.com/how-do-lorawan-gateways-work/)
- [Things to Consider When Picking A LoRaWAN Gateway](https://news.rakwireless.com/things-to-consider-when-picking-a-lorawan-gateway/)

:::

Here are the steps in configuring the [RAK7246 WisGate Developer D0](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisgate-developer/products/rak7246-lpwan-developer-gateway?variant=36313275465886):

1. By default, the gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode, which means that you can find an SSID named "**Rakwireless_XXXX**" on your PC Wi-Fi network list.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/rak-developer-kit/starter-kit/rak7246g-gateway/RAK7246G-1.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="RAKwireless Access Point"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE
‚ÄúXXXX‚Äù is the last 2 bytes of your RAK7246 WiFi MAC address. Connect to this Wi-Fi SSID using the password provided below. Also, the default IP address of the gateway provided below will be needed in connecting via SSH.

- Wi-Fi Password: **rakwireless**
- Default IP Address: **192.168.230.1**
:::

2. Log in to the gateway.

  - Windows OS
     SSH (Secure Shell) is typically used to log in to a remote machine and execute commands. There are a lot of free and good SSH Clients out there, namely [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), [BitVise SSH Client](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download), [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) and many more. Feel free to choose one that fits your needs, but in this guide, Putty is used.

  width="40%"
  caption="PuTTY example"
/>

  - Mac OS
     Open the Terminal of Mac OS. Launch the Terminal application found in the **`/Applications/Utilities/`** directory, but you can also launch it from Spotlight. Press **Command + Spacebar** and type **‚ÄúTerminal‚Äù**, then return.

<rk-img

  width="50%"
  caption="Selecting Terminal on Mac"
/>

3. If you have connected to the gateway through Wi-Fi AP Mode, the IP Address is **192.168.230.1**. It will then prompt you to enter the username and password. Enter the default credentials:

   - Username: **pi**
   - Password: **raspberry**

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/rak-developer-kit/starter-kit/rak7246g-gateway/RAK7246G-3.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Command Line using SSH Client Software"
/>

4. From the previous step, get the **Gateway ID** by typing `sudo gateway-config` to your chosen SSH Client terminal editor. It can be found on top of the terminal console, as shown in the red box in **Figure 5**. You may copy it on a txt file or any notepad software. It will be used in setting up the gateway in [TTN V3](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/). See **Figure 5** for reference. You will use it also as Gateway EUI in the latter part of this guide.

:::tip üìù NOTE
In this guide, you will be using TTN (The Things Network) as the LNS (LoRaWAN Network Server). There are many other LNS available that you can use, as well. The configuration steps will be different depending on your chosen LNS, but the general LoRaWAN principle is the same.

Like for [RAK WisGate Edge Gateways](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisgate-edge), it has built-in LNS that you can use.

  width="60%"
  caption="sudo gateway-config mode"
/>

5. You can now connect your gateway through Wi-Fi to access TTN. It can easily be done with the wireless capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Zero W by choosing **"5 Configure WIFI"**. By default, the RAK7246 WisGate Developer D0 Gateway works in Wi-Fi AP Mode. For the gateway to connect to the router, it must work in Wi-Fi Client Mode.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/rak-developer-kit/starter-kit/rak7246g-gateway/RAK7246G-5.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Configuration options for WIFI"
/>

There are 5 options to choose from in the Wi-Fi configuration menu:

   1.  **Enable AP Mode/Disable Client Mode** - the gateway will work in Wi-Fi Access Point Mode after rebooting, while the Wi-Fi Client Mode will be disabled (this is the default mode).
   2.  **Enable Client Mode/Disable AP Mode** - the gateway will work in Wi-Fi Client mode after rebooting, while Wi-FI AP Mode will be disabled.
   3.  **Modify SSID and pwd for AP Mode** - used to modify the SSID and password of the Wi-Fi AP. Only works if the Wi-Fi AP Mode is enabled.
   4.  **Add New SSID for Client** - this is used if you want to connect to a new Wi-Fi network. Only works in Wi-Fi Client mode.
   5.  **Change Wi-Fi Country** - this is used to modify the Resident Country to match Wi-Fi standards.

:::tip üìù NOTE

To enable Wi-Fi Client Mode, you have to disable first the Wi-Fi AP Mode.

:::

6. Once Wi-Fi AP Mode has been disabled by choosing **"2 Enable Client Mode/Disable AP Mode"**, you can now then connect to a new Wi-Fi Network by choosing **"4 Add New SSID for Client"**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/rak-developer-kit/starter-kit/rak7246g-gateway/RAK7246G-6.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Add New SSID for Client"
/>

- Start by selecting your country of residence.

  width="60%"
  caption="Selecting Country of Residence"
/>

- Enter the SSID of the network you want to connect.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Ensure to input the correct Wi-Fi SSID and password, or you will not be able to connect to the RAK7246 again via SSH in Wi-Fi AP Mode. If stuck in this situation, follow the [Optional Configurations](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7246G/Quickstart/#optional-configurations) procedure listed in the Accessing the Internet, which is applicable for all Raspberry Pi-based gateways to work again in Wi-Fi AP mode.

  width="60%"
  caption="Password of the Wi-Fi"
/>

- Lastly, reboot the gateway using the command sudo reboot in the command line, and it will connect to the router successfully.

```
sudo reboot
```

7. After rebooting the RAK7246 WisGate Developer D0, you should check if it is connected successfully to your Wi-Fi network. You may use your local network modem/router admin console to check if RAK7246 is successfully connected.

In this example, the admin console can be accessed via `http://192.168.0.1`. It is also common to have it on `http://192.168.1.1` on some routers. Take note of the IP address allotted to the RAK7246 by your Wi-Fi

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/rak-developer-kit/starter-kit/rak7246g-gateway/RAK7246G-7-a.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Web UI of local modem/router"
/>

You can also use [Advance IP Scanner](https://download.advanced-ip-scanner.com/download/files/Advanced_IP_Scanner_2.5.3850.exe) for Windows OS, or [Angry IP Scanner](https://angryip.org/download/) for Mac OS, and locate the IP address of RAK7246 WisGate Developer D0 in your Wi-Fi device.

As seen in **Figure 12**, it is `192.168.0.28`, where the company is Raspberry Pi Foundation. You can use that IP address to configure other related parameters of `RAK7246 WisGate Developer D0` by logging in to the SSH Client Software, as stated in the previous step, now with the IP address of `RAK7246 WisGate Developer D0` from your Wi-Fi network.

:::tip üìù NOTE
- At this point, you can only access the RAK7246 via ssh on the allocated IP address by the Wi-Fi network. In this example, it is `192.168.0.28`.
- You cannot access anymore the RAK7246 console on its default IP `192.168.230.1`.

  width="80%"
  caption="Creating an Application"
/>

3. If you had no error during the previous step, you should now be on the application console page. The next step is to **add end-devices to your TTN application**. LoRaWAN specification enforces that each end-device has to be personalized and activated. There are two options for registering devices depending on the activation mode you select. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or Activation-By-Personalization (ABP).  You need to click **+ Add end device** as shown in **Figure 29**.

<rk-img

  width="80%"
  caption="OTAA settings"
/>

7. Then you need to put a unique End device ID and EUIs (DevEUI and AppEUI), as shown in **Figure 33**. Check if your RAK4631 module has a **DevEUI** on **sticker or QR** that you can scan, then use this as the device unique DevEUI.

For **AppEUI**, you can click **Fill with Zeros**.
Click **Generate** for the **AppKey**. Then the End Device Name will be automatically filled by the website. You can also put a different End Device ID if you need to. Finally, click **Register End Device**.

#### RAK4631 Hardware Setup

This section is about the actual device configuration.

The RAK4631 will not work without a WisBlock Base board. In this kit, you have RAK5005-O as the WisBlock Base board. The WisBlock Base provides a USB connection for programming the RAK4631. It also provides a power source and various interfaces to RAK4631 so that it can be connected to other WisBlock modules via different module slots.

To illustrate, RAK4631 can be connected to RAK5005-O WisBlock Base, as shown in **Figure 35**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/RAK5005-connect.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="RAK4631 Connection to WisBlock Base RAK5005-O"
/>

There are a few pins that are exposed on RAK5005-O, and you can easily use them via header pins. The labels are at the back, as shown in **Figure 36**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/IO-pins.png"
  width="35%"
  caption="WisBlock Base exposed pins"
/>

More information can be found on the [official documentation of the specific WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) you used in your project.

For RAK5005-O WisBlock Base with RAK4631 WisBlock Core, the accessible GPIO pins are defined as follows in the Arduino IDE and Platform IO:

- `WB_IO1` for IO1 pin
- `WB_IO2` for IO2 pin (Also used to control the 3.3&nbsp;V supply of some WisBlock Modules to achieve low-power IoT devices.)
- `WB_A0` for AIN

There are usable LEDs, as well, that can be controlled by the RAK4631 on the WisBlock Base board:

- `LED_GREEN`
- `LED_BLUE`

UART1 and I2C_1 are also exposed on the header of the WisBlock Base board.

- RAK4631 has a native USB peripheral onboard (Serial), which is used for programming and Serial debugging and two usable hardware **UART1** and **UART2** (Serial 1 and Serial 2). **UART1** is accessible to WisBlock Slot A, WisBlock IO slot, and the exposed header pins. **UART2** is accessible only on the WisBlock IO slot.
- The **I2C_1** header pins are as well shared to the WisBlock Base Slots A to D. The second **I2C_2** is available only on the WisBlock IO slot.
#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

**Figure 37** shows how to mount the RAK4631 module on top of a WisBlock Base board (RAK5005-O). Follow carefully the procedure defined in [WisBlock module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) in order to secure the connection safely. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/datasheet/mounting-sketch.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="RAK4631 Mounting Sketch"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/16.removing-screws.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/17.detaching-silkscreen.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module"
/>

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 40**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/18.detaching-module.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Applying even forces on the proper location of a WisBlock module"

##### LoRa and BLE Antenna

Another important part component of RAK4631 is the antennas.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/lora-antenna.png"
  width="30%"
  caption="LoRa Antenna"
/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/ble-antenna.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="BLE Antenna"
/>

You need to ensure that the antenna is properly connected to have a good LoRa signal. Do not power the module without an antenna connected to the IPEX connector to avoid damage to the RF section of the chip.

RAK4631 has a label on its sticker where to connect the antennas, as shown in **Figure 43**.

:::tip üìù NOTE
Detailed information about the RAK4631 BLE and LoRa antenna can be found on the [antenna datasheet](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/#LoRa/WisBlock/Accessories/).
:::

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
When using the LoRa or Bluetooth Low Energy transceivers, make sure that an antenna is always connected. Using these transceivers without an antenna can damage the system. Make sure to fix the module with the screws to ensure a proper function.
:::

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming the RAK1906.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- Battery can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the RAK WisBlock Base Board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.

#### Creating LoRaButton Application

Once the RAK4631 is connected to RAK5005-O WisBlock Base, You can connect a push button to the **RAK5005-O WisBlock Base**, having its terminals, one in  `WB_IO1` for IO1 pin, and the other one in `GND`. At the end of this guide, you should have a LoRaWAN device where a LoRaWAN uplink packet will be transmitted every time that button will be pressed.

This section explains the default settings and how to configure them.

1. Setup the region.

Default is **EU868**.

```c
LoRaMacRegion_t g_CurrentRegion = LORAMAC_REGION_EU868;
```

You can change this to a region that applies to you like `LORAMAC_REGION_US915`, `LORAMAC_REGION_AU915`, etc.

2. Setup the activation method.

Default is **OTAA**.

```c
bool doOTAA = true;
```

To configure the device to ABP, you need to make this boolean variable `false`.

3. Setup the message type if confirmed or not.

Default is **confirmed message**.

```c
lmh_confirm g_CurrentConfirm = LMH_CONFIRMED_MSG;
```
You can change to unconfirmed message by changing the value to `LMH_UNCONFIRMED_MSG`.

4. Setup device class.

Default is **Class A**.

```c
DeviceClass_t g_CurrentClass = CLASS_A;
```
You can change this to `CLASS_B` (still under development) or `CLASS_C`.

5. Setup the EUIs and KEY. Get these parameters from the [Connecting RAK4631 to TTN V3 Application](/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK-Developer-Kit-1-Guide/#connecting-rak4631-to-ttn-v3-application) section of this guide. It is very important that the EUI and KEY will match the one configured in the TTN application. Otherwise, your device will not be able to connect to the TTN server. In this application, the device is activated via OTAA so you need to configure the Device EUI, Application EUI, and Application Key.

```c
uint8_t nodeDeviceEUI[8] = {0x70, 0xB3, 0xD5, 0x7E, 0xD0, 0x04, 0xAD, 0x3D};
uint8_t nodeAppEUI[8] = {0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00};
uint8_t nodeAppKey[16] = {0x80, 0x3B, 0x4F, 0xE5, 0xCC, 0x76, 0xDF, 0x81, 0x21, 0xC1, 0x27, 0xC4, 0xBB, 0x74, 0x90, 0xF3};
```

##### LoRaWAN Payload

This LoRaButton Application will send an integer `1` to the LoRaWAN server when the button is pressed. This is set up on the `void loop()` function.

```c
int stat=digitalRead(WB_IO1);
  if(!stat){
    send_lora_frame();
    delay(5000);
  }
```
This is setup on the `void send_lora_frame(void)` function. The data will be send to the LoRaWAN Server. The LoRaWAN payload is packaged in this function.
```c
 if (lmh_join_status_get() != LMH_SET)
  {
    //Not joined, try again later
    return;
  }

  uint32_t i = 0;
  memset(m_lora_app_data.buffer, 0, LORAWAN_APP_DATA_BUFF_SIZE);
  m_lora_app_data.port = gAppPort;
  m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = 1;
  m_lora_app_data.buffsize = i;

  lmh_error_status error = lmh_send(&m_lora_app_data, g_CurrentConfirm);
  if (error == LMH_SUCCESS)
  {
    count++;
    Serial.printf("lmh_send ok count %d\n", count);
  }
  else
  {
    count_fail++;
    Serial.printf("lmh_send fail count %d\n", count_fail);
  }
```


##### Uploading the Arduino Code

After all the configuration is done and the payload is already formatted properly, you can now compile and upload the code.

:::tip üìù NOTE
On the other hand, if the error is related to the difficulty of uploading the FW, try to double-click the reset button on the WisBlock Base board and reupload it again.
:::

With the LoRaButton code successfully uploaded, you can now try to press the button on your device that you have set up earlier.

Then check again your **The Things Stack** account and go to **Applications** > `<name of your application>` > **Live Data**. Wait for the uplink LoRaWAN payload every time you will press the button.
