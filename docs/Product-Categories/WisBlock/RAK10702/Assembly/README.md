# RAK10702 WisBlock Indoor Comfort Node Assembly Guide

This guide shows you step by step how to assemble the electronic components and how to assemble them in the (optional) enclosure. This guide is for the version with the 4.2" E-Ink display. If you are using the version without the display, you can skip certain steps.

## Assembly Guide

As the RAK10702 is a DIY product, this document will guide how to correctly assemble the electronic components and place them in the optional available 3D-printed enclosure.

### Assemble the Front Sensor Component RAK13013

1. Plug the Wisblock RAK1901, RAK12010 and RAK12047 on the RAK13013 sensor carrier module. Fix the modules with 3 pcs M1.2*3 Screws.

### Prepare the Display

::: tip üìù NOTE

This step is only required if the kit includes the E-Ink display.

:::

Stick the adhesive EVA on the back of the display screen. The distance to the edge is 1&nbsp;mm.

<!-- Refer to the image for the positioning.  -->

### Prepare the Enclosure Lid

Tear off the release paper of the glass, and stick the glass on the top cover.

::: tip üìù NOTE

The glass is not included in the PCB kits. It should be ordered separately.

### Assemble the Front Sensor Carrier and the Base Board on the Enclosure Lid

1. Fix the front sensor carrier PCB on the mounting plate with 3 pcs. of ST2.0*3 Self tapping screws. The FPC passes through the slot on the mounting plate.
