# RAK19003 WisBlock Mini Base Board Datasheet

## WisBlock Mini Base Overview

RAK19003 WisBlock Mini Base module is the new main board that allows you to attach WisBlock modules through the standardized expansion connectors. In addition, the WisBlock Mini Base module also comprises a Type-C USB connector, indicator LEDs, button, and sensor connectors.

If you can't find a module that fits your IoT requirements, use the standard connectors of WisBlock to develop your own specific function module. WisBlock supports open-source hardware architecture and you can find tutorials showing how to create your own [Awesome WisBlock](https://github.com/RAKWireless/Awesome-WisBlock) module.

## Specifications

### Overview

**RAK19003** is a **WisBlock Base** board that connects **WisBlock Core** and **WisBlock Modules**. It provides the power supply and interconnection to the modules attached to it. It has one slot reserved for the WisBlock Core module and two Slot C-D for WisBlock Modules. The WisBlock Core is attached on the top side, and the WisBlock Modules are attached to the bottom side of the RAK19003 WisBlock Base board. Slot D holds modules up to 23&nbsp;mm in size, while Slot C supports 10&nbsp;mm WisBlock Modules. Also, there are two **2.54&nbsp;mm pitch headers** for extension interface with **BOOT**, **I2C**, and **UART** pins.

For convenience, there is a Type-C USB connector that is connected directly to WisBlock Core MCU‚Äôs USB port (if supported) or to a USB-UART converter depending on the WisBlock Core. It can be used for uploading firmware or serial communication. The USB-C connector is also used as a battery charging port.

WisBlock Modules are connected to the RAK19003 WisBlock Base board via **high-speed board to board connectors**. They provide secure and reliable interconnection to ensure the signal integrity of each data bus. A set of screws are used for fixing the modules, which makes it reliable even in an environment with lots of vibrations.

Using **RAK19003** as your WisBlock Base board, you can make your project compact, which is ideal in small enclosures. You can also use a [RAK19005 WisBlock Sensor Extension Cable](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/fpc-extension-cable-for-slot-a-to-d-rak19005) to position WisBlock Modules apart from the WisBlock Base board or in any part of your case.

:::tip üìù NOTE
The RAK19003, as any electronic equipment, is sensitive to **electrostatic discharge (ESD)**. Improper handling can cause permanent damage to the module.
:::

##### Current Consumption

The RAK19003 is designed for **low-power IoT products**. Its power supply uses a high-efficiency low ground current regulator. When there is no module on RAK19003, the **leakage current is lower than 2&nbsp;¬µA**. With WisBlock Core and WisBlock sensor on it, the sleep current is **lower than 10&nbsp;¬µA**. When a LoRa module is transmitting, the current may reach **130&nbsp;mA**.

| **Conditions**                                                      | **Current** | **Unit** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Leakage current, without any module on RAK19003                     | 2           | ¬µA       |
| Idle current, with WisBlock Core and WisBlock Modules in sleep mode | 10          | ¬µA       |
| Working current, with LoRa module transmitting                      | 130         | ¬µA       |
| Maximum output current                                              | 750         | mA       |

##### Battery Connector

The RAK19003 WisBlock Mini Base Board can be powered by a battery, connected to the **P2 connector**. The nominal operating voltage of the battery should be within the range shown in the following table. The matching connector for the battery wires is a [JST PHR-2 2&nbsp;mm pitch female](https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=199)

| **Minimum** | **Typical** | **Maximum** | **Unit** |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 3.3         | 3.7         | 4.3         | V        |

The USB connector is used as a charging port. The voltage and current fed to the battery through the port should not exceed its charging limits, as shown in the table below.

| **Parameter**    | **Value**        |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Charging Voltage | 4.5 ‚Äì 5.5&nbsp;V |
| Charging Current | 350&nbsp;mA      |

A suitable Li-Ion battery should have the following parameters as shown in the table below:

| **Parameter**     | **Value**            |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Standard Voltage  | 3.7&nbsp;V           |
| Charging Voltage  | 4.2&nbsp;V           |
| Capacity          | As required          |
| Discharge current | At least 500&nbsp;mA |


:::tip üìù NOTE
Don't use a non-rechargeable battery.
