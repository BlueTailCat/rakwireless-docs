# RAK5148 WisLink LPWAN 2.4 GHz Concentrator Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

RAK5148 is a 2.4&nbsp;GHz LPWAN concentrator module with a mini-PCIe form factor based on Semtech SX1280, which enables easy integration into an existing router or other network equipment with LPWAN gateway capabilities. It can be used on any embedded platform offering a free mini-PCIe slot with an SPI/USB connection. Furthermore, a ZOE-M8Q GPS chip is integrated onboard.

### Features

- Designed based on a **mini-PCIe form factor**
- 3+1 SX1280 (3 for receive, 1 for transmit)
- 3.3&nbsp;V **Mini PCI-e**, compatible with **3G/LTE card** of mini-PCIe type
- Tx power up to 27&nbsp;dBm, Rx sensitivity down to -132&nbsp;dBm @ SF12, BW 203&nbsp;kHz
- Supports optional **SPI/USB** interfaces
- Fine Timestamp
- Built-in **ZOE-M8Q** GPS module (optional)

## Specifications

### Overview

The overview shows the top and back views of the RAK5148 board. It also presents the block diagram that discusses how the board works.

#### Board Overview

RAK5148 is a compact LPWAN Gateway Module suitable for integration in systems where mass and size constraints are essential. It is designed with the PCI Express Mini Card form factor in mind, so it can easily become a part of products that comply with the standard, which allows for cards with a thickness of at least 5.5&nbsp;mm.

The board has two UFL interfaces for the LoRa and GNSS antennas and a standard 52-pin connector (mPCIe).

#### Block Diagram

The RAK5148 Concentrator is equipped with four (4) SX1280 chips. Three of them work as 2.4&nbsp;GHz LoRa receivers (3 channels), and one works as a transmitter.

### Hardware

The hardware is categorized into seven parts. It discusses the interface, pinouts, and their corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the parameters and standard values of the board.


#### Interfaces

- **Power Supply** - The RAK5148 concentrator module must be supplied through the 3.3&nbsp;V<sub>aux</sub> pins by a DC power supply. The voltage needs to be stable since the current drawn can vary significantly during operation based on the power consumption profile of the SX1280 chip.
- **SPI Interface** - SPI interface mainly provides for the `Host_SCK`, `Host_MISO`, `Host_MOSI`, and `Host_CSN` pins of the system connector. The SPI interface gives access to the configuration register of the SX1280 via an MCU STM32F446RCT6. Only the slave side is implemented.
- **USB Interface** - The USB interface mainly provides for the `USB_D+` and` USB_D-` pins of the system connector. The USB interface gives access to the configuration register of the SX1280 via an MCU STM32F446RCT6. Only the slave side is implemented.
- **UART and I2C Interface** - RAK5148 integrates a ZOE-M8Q GPS module, which has a UART and I2C interface. The PINs on the golden finger provide a UART connection and an I2C connection, which allow direct access to the GPS module. The PPS signal is not only connected to STM32F446RCT6 internally but also connected to the golden finger which can be used by the host board.
- **GPS_PPS** - RAK5148 includes the `GPS_PPS` input for received packets time-stamped and fine-timestamped.
- **RESET** - RAK5148 USB and SPI cards' RESET is controlled by the MCU.
- **Antenna RF Interface** - The module has one RF interface over a standard UFL connector (Hirose U. FL-R-SMT) with a characteristic impedance of 50&nbsp;Î©. The RF port supports both Tx and Rx, providing the antenna interface.

#### Electrical Requirements

:::warning â ï¸ WARNING
Stressing the device above one or more of the ratings listed in the Absolute Maximum Rating section may cause permanent damage. These are stress ratings only. Operating the module at these or any conditions other than those specified in the Operating Conditions sections of the specification should be avoided. Exposure to Absolute Maximum Rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.
:::

The operating condition range defines those limits within which the functionality of the device is guaranteed. Where application information is given, it is advisory only and does not form part of the specification.


##### Absolute Maximum Rating

The limiting values given below are following the Absolute Maximum Rating System (IEC 134).

:::tip ð NOTE
Although this module is designed to be as robust as possible, electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage the module. This module must always be protected from ESD when handling or transporting. Static charges may easily produce potentials of several kilovolts on the human body or equipment, which can discharge without detection. Industry-standard ESD handling precautions should be used at all times.
