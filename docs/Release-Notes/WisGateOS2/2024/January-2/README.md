:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT
- The WisGateOS2 firmware has been updated significantly. After this update, it is ***no longer possible*** to revert to previous versions of WisDM or the local WebUI. All WisGateOS2 2.2.x extensions are digitally signed. During this process, extensions will automatically update. Contact RAK support before updating the WireGuard Extension.
- An internet connection is mandatory for the update process. This is because the new firmware signature needs to be confirmed, and the Extension Gallery should be accessible to update the already installed extensions.
