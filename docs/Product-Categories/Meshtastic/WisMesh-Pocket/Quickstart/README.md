## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

The WisMesh Pocket comes fully assembled with an internal battery. However, it is recommended to fully recharge the battery before switching the device on. It supports Li-Ion batteries, 5&nbsp;V (e.g. from solar panel) supply, integrated user button, battery disconnect switch and a dedicated connector for a 1.3&nbsp;inches OLED display.

WisMesh Pocket also includes all GPIOs on pin headers, three WisBlock Sensor Slots, one WisBlock IO slot, and an integrated GNSS location chip on the Base Board.

The WisMesh Pocket is based on the WisMesh Base Board, which is specifically designed for the Meshtastic usage. Technical details of the WisMesh Base Board can be found in the <a href="/Product-Categories/Meshtastic/WisMesh-Base/Datasheet/#battery-and-solar-panel-/-5v-connection" target="_blank">WisMesh Base Board</a> documentation.

#### Battery Connector and Solar Panel (5 V) Connector

The WisMesh Pocket has internal a connector for a Li-Ion battery. In case the battery needs to be changed, double check the polarity of the battery cable. The matching connector for the battery wires is a <a href="https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=199" target="_blank">JST PHR-2 2&nbsp;mm pitch female</a>.

WisMesh Pocket also has an internal connector for direct 5&nbsp;V supply or connection of a solar panel. In case this connector is used, make sure to double-check the polarity of the supply cable.

The matching connector for the solar panel wires is an <a href="https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=287" target="_blank">JST ZHR-2 1.5&nbsp;mm pitch female</a>.
