   ```bash
   unzip greengrass-nucleus-latest.zip -d *GreengrassInstaller*

   rm greengrass-nucleus-latest.zip
   ```
2. Verify the version of the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software:
   ```bash
   java -jar ./*GreengrassInstaller*/lib/Greengrass.jar --version
   ```
3. You will see the Greengrass version displayed - similar to **AWS Greengrass v2.4.0**.

#### Provide Your Credentials

Run the following commands to provide the credentials to the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software:

   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<the access key id for your account>

   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<the secret access key for your account>
   ```

#### Run the Installer

1. Run the installer using the command provided. Modify the values as per your region, install the directory, and set up the **thing** name.
2. Use the `--provision true` option to have the installer set up the **thing** and required policies for you. If you prefer to configure Greengrass manually, see the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/manual-installation.html).
   ```bash
   sudo -E java -Droot="/greengrass/v2" -Dlog.store=FILE \

   -jar ./GGCoreInstall/lib/Greengrass.jar \

   --aws-region us-west-2 \

   --thing-name thing-name \

   --tes-role-name GreengrassV2TokenExchangeRole \

   --tes-role-alias-name GreengrassCoreTokenExchangeRoleAlias \

   --component-default-user ggc_user:ggc_group \

   --provision true \

   --setup-system-service true \

   --deploy-dev-tools true
   ```
3. If all goes well, you will see the following output on the device console:
    ```
    Successfully configured Nucleus with provisioned resource details!

    Configured Nucleus to deploy aws.greengrass.Cli component

    Successfully set up Nucleus as a system service
    ```
4. The local development tools, specified by the **`--deploy-dev-tools`** option, take some time to deploy. The following command can be used to check the status of this deployment:
   ```bash
   aws greengrassv2 list-effective-deployments --core-device-thing-name thing-name
   ```
5. When the status is SUCCEEDED, run the following command to verify whether the Greengrass CLI is installed and runs on your device. Replace `/greengrass/v2` with the path to the base folder on your device as needed.
   ```bash
   /greengrass/v2/bin/greengrass-cli help
   ```
