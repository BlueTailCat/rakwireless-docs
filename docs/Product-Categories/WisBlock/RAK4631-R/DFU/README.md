## Firmware Update via USB

After connecting your RAK4631-R to WisBlock Base, you can immediately update its firmware via USB.

- [Using Windows](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/DFU/#for-windows)
- [Using Linux](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/DFU/#for-linux)
- [Using MacOS](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/DFU/#for-macos)

### For Windows

1. [Check the FW version of your RAK4631-R](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/DFU/#how-to-check-firmware-version-using-tera-term). If it is not the latest firmware version (you can check the [FW change logs](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/RUI/RUI3/Image/)), you can update the firmware of your device.
2. Create a new folder in your `C:\` drive named `RAK4631-R Update`.
3. Download the [nRFutil.exe](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil/releases) and the [latest DFU Package](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/RUI/RUI3/Image/RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip). Once you downloaded both files, put them in the `RAK4631-R Update` folder you created as shown in Figure 1.

  width="70%"
  caption="nRFutil.exe and RAK4631-R Latest Firmware"
/>

4. Connect the RAK4631-R via USB and check if port has been detected via device manager. In this guide it is detected as COM32. The COM port number is not fixed and can be different depending on the PC. If no port is shown in device manager, you can try to double click reset button on the WisBlock Base and check again.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631-r/dfu/2_device_manager_port_update.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Checking COM Port via Device Manager"
/>

5. After that, you need to send `AT+BOOT` command to the device. You can follow the [guide on using Tera Term](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/DFU/#how-to-check-firmware-version-using-tera-term) but instead of checking the firmware version, you have to input `AT+BOOT`. You will see no reply since the module will restart then will be disconnected momentarily before re-establishing again the connection to Tera Term.

::: tip üìù NOTE
You have to disconnect the device connection to Tera Term or close it so that the COM port will be free when you do the firmware update on the next step. Else, you will have error during FW update.

  width="70%"
  caption="AT+BOOT to Initialize Boot Mode"
/>

6. After initiating Boot mode, you can now execute the firmware update. You need to open command prompt and must be in `RAK4631-R Update` folder directory to do the firmware update. This is folder where you place the nRFutil and the latest firmware. You need to input `cd C:/RAK4631-R Update/` followed  by `nrfutil.exe dfu serial -pkg RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip -p COM32`. You have to ensure that you have the right `.zip` file name and `COM port number` to avoid errors.

3. Add `.local` folder to Linux `$PATH` variable.

```
export PATH="$HOME/.local:$PATH"
```

4. Now, you can install `adafruit-nrfutil` and `nrfutil`.

`nrfutil` and `adafruit-nrfutil` are available as a package in the Python Package Index (PyPI). Execute the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get update
pip3 install nrfutil --user
pip3 install adafruit-nrfutil==0.5.3.post16 --user
```

#### Execute the Firmware Update via USB

1. Download the zip file [DFU Distribution Package](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/RUI/RUI3/Image/RAK4631_latest_dfu_package.zip).

When you plug in the RAK4631-R through the USB to Linux, you will see the related information "**cdc_acm 1-1:1.0:  ttyACM0: USB ACM device**" from the `dmesg` command.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631-r/dfu/dmesg-tty.png"

#### Uploading the RAK4631-R Firmware

After updating the bootloader, you can now upload the RAK4631-R firmware by following the steps below. You have to note that the RAK4631-R firmware used in this section is a dedicated firmware designed for updating RAK4631 to RAK4631-R.

1. Download the [nrfutil](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil/releases/download/v6.1.3/nrfutil-mac.1). Usually, the `nrfutil-mac.1` file will go to the downloads folder. This section assumes any downloaded file goes to downloads folder.

2. If your terminal is not yet open, open the terminal and go to the downloads directory or the location where you put the downloaded file. You have to change the `username` based on your machine. In this guide, `apple` is used as the user.

```
cd /Users/username/Downloads
```

3. Make the `nrfutil-mac.1` executable.

```
chmod +x nrfutil-mac.1
```

5. Download the [RAK4631 to RAK4631-R Conversion](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/RUI/RUI3/Bootloader%20Upgrade/) firmware. Usually, the `rui3_rak4631_latest.zip` file will go to the downloads folder.

6. You can now execute the firmware update.

::: tip üìù NOTE
- The `nrfutil-mac.1` must be on the same folder with the `rui3_rak4631_latest.zip`. In this guide it is **Downloads** folder.
- You should be connected on the right port. The port name in your computer might be different than the one in this guide.
- It might take a while for the update. Do not remove the USB or terminate the terminal application while doing the uploading process.
:::

```
./nrfutil-mac.1 dfu usb-serial -pkg rui3_rak4631_latest.zip -p /dev/cu.usbmodemC0D048F6604F1
```

  width="60%"
  caption="Successful RAK4631-R Conversion"
/>

7. After the success FW upload, your RAK4631 is now RAK4631-R. Open a serial terminal software and run `AT+VER=?` to see the FW version.

```
AT+VER=3.2.0-p2_22q1_final.87
OK
```


## Converting RAK4631-R to RAK4631

You have the option to convert your RAK4631-R to RAK4631.

1. Download the necessary files needed for conversion. You need to have the [`rak4631_factory_application.zip`, `rak4631_factory_bootloader.zip`, `rak4631_factory_softdevice.zip`](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/RUI/RUI3/Bootloader%20Upgrade/), and [nrfutil.exe](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil/releases) in a common folder.

2. Create a new folder in your `C:\` drive named `RAK4631 Bootloader to RUI v3` and place all the conversion files you downloaded from the previous step.

  width="70%"
  caption="RAK4631-R Conversion FW files and NRFUTIL"
/>

3. Connect the RAK4631-R via USB and check if port has been detected via device manager. In this guide it is detected as COM32. The COM port number is not fixed and can be different depending on the PC. If no port is shown in device manager, you can try to double click reset button on the WisBlock Base and check again.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631-r/dfu/2_device_manager_port_update.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Checking COM Port via Device Manager"
/>

4. After that, you need to send `AT+BOOT` command to the device. You can follow the [guide on using Tera Term](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/DFU/#how-to-check-firmware-version-using-tera-term) but instead of checking the firmware version, you have to input `AT+BOOT`. You will see no reply since the module will restart then will be disconnected momentarily before re-establishing again the connection to Tera Term.

::: tip üìù NOTE
You have to disconnect the device connection to Tera Term or close it so that the COM port will be free when you do the firmware update on the next step. Else, you will have error during FW update.

  width="70%"
  caption="AT+BOOT to Initialize Boot Mode"
/>

5. After initiating Boot mode, you can now execute the firmware conversion. Open the command prompt and change directory via `cd C:\RAK4631 Bootloader to RUI v3\`. After that, you can now execute the conversion using the command below.  You have to ensure that you have the right `.zip` file name and `COM port number` to avoid errors.

  width="90%"
  caption="RAK4631-R to RAK4631 Conversion"
/>

6. After the successful upload, you can now see RAK4631 drive detected. This indicates that the device has now the Arduino BSP bootloader on it and ready to be uploaded with firmware created using the WisBlock Arduino BSP and not RUI3. You also need to check the COM port number since it will changed once you convert to Arduino BSP bootloader.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If there is no RAK4631 drive detected, try to double-click on the reset button on the WisBlock Base.
