# RAK2470 WisNode Bridge Serial Prime

## Overview

### Description

The **RAK2470 WisNode Bridge Serial Prime** is an RS485 to LoRaWAN converter designed for outdoor industrial applications. It uses LoRaWAN network to wirelessly transmit RS485 data to and from the end devices. This device also has an RS485 interface that can connect to any RS485 device, such as an MPPT Solar Charge Controller, Inverter, or Inverter Integrated Machine.

The WisNode Bridge can be customized using the adapter cable. One end is matched with the J4 connector of the PCBA, while the other can be matched to the use case. Although two pre-existing options are offered (USB 3.0 Connector and 4-pin Circular Connector), customization is still possible upon request.

RAK2470, together with a RAK WisGate gateway and LoRa Server products, can quickly and easily build a wireless industrial field control system. It adopts an industrial protection design, supports a wide range of voltage supplies, supports pole mounting, and facilitates field installation and use.
