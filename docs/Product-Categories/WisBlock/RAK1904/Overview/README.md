## Product Description

RAK1904 is a WisBlock Sensor that extends the WisBlock system with an ST LIS3DH 3-axis acceleration sensor. A ready-to-use SW library and tutorial make it easy to build up a motion detection and acceleration data acquisition system. It has an ultra-low-power high-performance three-axis linear accelerometer with a digital I2C interface. The device features ultra-low-power operational modes that allow advanced power saving and smart embedded functions.

The accelerometer of the RAK1904 module can be dynamically configured to work in the scales of ¬±2g/¬±4g/¬±8g/¬±16g and is capable of measuring accelerations with output data rates from 1&nbsp;Hz to 5.3&nbsp;kHz.

## Product Features

* **Sensor specifications**
    * User select able scales of ¬±2g/¬±4g/¬±8g/¬±16g
    * Data acquisition rates from 1&nbsp;Hz to 5.3&nbsp;kHz
    * Voltage Supply: 3.3&nbsp;V
    * Current Consumption: 0.5&nbsp;uA to 11&nbsp;uA
    * Chipset: ST LIS3DH

* **Size**
    * 10 x 10&nbsp;mm

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK1904**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** provides power supply to the **RAK1904** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to use the sensor.
