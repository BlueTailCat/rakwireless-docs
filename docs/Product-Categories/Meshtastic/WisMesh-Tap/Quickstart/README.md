## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

The WisMesh Tap comes fully assembled with an internal battery. However, it is recommended to fully recharge the battery before switching the device on. It supports Li-Ion batteries, 5&nbsp;V (e.g. from solar panel) supply, a 320x240 TFT touchscreen, and an on-screen keyboard.

WisMesh Tap also includes all GPIOs on pin headers, and an integrated GNSS location chip.

The WisMesh Tap is based on the RAKwireless RAK10701 Field Tester. Technical details of the RAKwireless RAK10701 Field Tester can be found in the <a href="/Product-Categories/WisNode/RAK10701-L/Datasheet/#rak10701-l-field-tester-for-lorawan-datasheet" target="_blank">RAK10701 Field Tester</a> documentation.

#### Charging and Debugging via USB-C

The WisMesh Tap has a USB-C connector for recharging the device.

#### Recharge the Battery

To recharge the device, plug a USB-C cable into the device and connected it to a 5&nbsp;V 2&nbsp;A USB wall charger. Recharging the battery via a USB port on your computer is not recommended due to the potential low current output.

#### Antenna

The LoRa antenna needs to be plugged into the RP-SMA connector of the WisMesh Tap. Make sure the connector is screwed in correct and is secured by tightening the connection.

::: tip üìù NOTE
The BLE antenna and GNSS antenna are inside the enclosure and already connected.
