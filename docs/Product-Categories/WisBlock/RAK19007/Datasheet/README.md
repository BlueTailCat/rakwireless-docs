# RAK19007 WisBlock Base Board 2nd Gen Datasheet

## WisBlock Base Board 2nd Gen Overview

**RAK19007** is a **WisBlock Base Board 2nd Gen** that connects **WisBlock Core**, **WisBlock IO**, and **WisBlock Modules**. It provides the power supply and interconnection to the modules attached to it. It has one slot reserved for the WisBlock Core module and four slots A-D for WisBlock modules. The WisBlock Core is attached on the top side, and the WisBlock modules are attached to the top or bottom side of the RAK19007. The Slot D holds modules up to 23&nbsp;mm in size, while slots A to C support 10&nbsp;mm WisBlock modules. Also, there are three **2.54&nbsp;mm pitch headers** for extension interface with **BOOT**, **GPIO**, **I2C**, and **UART** pins.

For convenience, there is a Type-C USB connector that is connected directly to WisBlock Core MCU‚Äôs USB port (if supported) or to a USB-UART converter depending on the WisBlock Core. It can be used for uploading firmware or serial communication. The USB-C connector is also used as a battery charging port.

WisBlock modules are connected to the RAK19007 WisBlock Base board via high-speed board-to-board connectors. They provide secure and reliable interconnection to ensure the signal integrity of each data bus. A set of screws are used for fixing the modules, which makes it reliable even in an environment with lots of vibrations.

You can also use a [RAK19005 WisBlock Sensor Extension Cable](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/fpc-extension-cable-for-slot-a-to-d-rak19005) to position the WisBlock modules apart from the WisBlock Base board or in any part of your case.

**RAK19007** has connectors for the following:

* 1 WisBlock Core module
* 1 WisBlock compatible with IO slot
* 4 WisBlock modules compatible with slots A-D
* 1 Type-C USB port for programming and debugging
* 3.7&nbsp;V Rechargeable battery connector
* 5&nbsp;V Solar panel connector
* Four 4-pin header with BOOT, I2C, and UART pins accessible with solder contacts

Additionally, it has two user-definable LEDs, one power supply/charging indicator LED, and a reset button.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

**Improvements from RAK5005-O Base board**

- J11 header Analog input changed from AIN0 to AIN1.
- Upgraded to USB C connector.
- Slot D position changed with added TX1/RX1 availability to it.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
The RAK19007, as any electronic equipment, is sensitive to **electrostatic discharge (ESD)**. Improper handling can cause permanent damage to the module.
:::

##### Current Consumption

The RAK19007 is designed for **low-power IoT products**, and the power supply uses a high-efficiency low grounding current regulator. When there is no module on RAK19007, the **leakage current is lower than 2 ¬µA**. With WisBlock Core and WisBlock Sensor on it, the sleep current is **lower than 10&nbsp;¬µA**. When a LoRa module is transmitting, the current may reach **130&nbsp;mA**.

| **Conditions**                                   | **Current** | **Unit** |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | -------- |
| Leakage current, without any module on RAK19007  | 2           | ¬µA       |
| Idle current, with MCU and sensors in sleep mode | 10          | ¬µA       |
| Working current, with LoRa module transmitting   | 130         | mA       |


##### Battery Connector

The RAK19007 WisBlock Base Board 2nd Gen can be powered by a rechargeable battery, connected to the **P2 connector**. The nominal operating voltage of the battery should be within the range shown in the following table. The matching connector for the battery wires is an [JST PHR-2 2&nbsp;mm pitch female](https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=199)

| **Minimum** | **Typical** | **Maximum** | **Unit** |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 3.3         | 3.7         | 4.3         | V        |

<br>

The Type-C USB connector is used as a charging port. The voltage and current fed to the battery through the port should not exceed its charging limits, as shown in the table below.

| **Parameter**    | **Value**        |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Charging voltage | 4.5 ‚Äì 5.5&nbsp;V |
| Charging current | 350&nbsp;mA      |

<br>

A suitable Li-Ion battery should have the following parameters as shown in the table below:

| **Parameter**     | **Value**            |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Standard voltage  | 3.7&nbsp;V           |
| Charging voltage  | 4.2&nbsp;V           |
| Capacity          | As required          |
| Discharge current | At least 500&nbsp;mA |


:::tip üìù NOTE
Do not use a non-rechargeable battery.

##### Solar Panel Connector

A 5&nbsp;V solar panel can be connected to the board via the **P1 connector**. The solar panel can also be used to charge the Li-Ion battery. The matching connector for the solar panel wires is an [JST ZHR-2 1.5&nbsp;mm pitch female](https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=287).
