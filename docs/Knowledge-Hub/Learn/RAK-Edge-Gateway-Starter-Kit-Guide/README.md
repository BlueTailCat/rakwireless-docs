# WisBlock Starter Kit and RAK Edge Gateway Complete LoRaWAN Guide

## Overview

This guide is about learning how to set up a complete LoRaWAN application from device, gateway up to network server.

This guide is composed of the following section:
- [Setting Up the Gateway](/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK-Edge-Gateway-Starter-Kit-Guide/#setting-up-the-gateway)
- [Setting Up the Network Server](/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK-Edge-Gateway-Starter-Kit-Guide/#setting-up-the-network-server)
- [Setting Up the Device](/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK-Edge-Gateway-Starter-Kit-Guide/#setting-up-the-device)

:::tip üìù NOTE:
If you are new to LoRaWAN, here are a few good references about LoRaWAN and gateways:

- [LoRaWAN 101](https://news.rakwireless.com/lorawan-r-101-all-you-need-to-know/)
- [What is a LoRaWAN Gateway?](https://news.rakwireless.com/what-is-a-lorawan-gateway/)

:::

##### Access the Gateway

In this section, several ways of accessing the gateway are provided to have different alternatives for you to choose from depending on the availability of the requirements needed.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Do not power the device if the LoRa Antenna port has been left open to avoid potential damage to the RAK7268/RAK7268C WisGate Edge Lite 2.
:::

##### Wi-Fi AP Mode

By default, the gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode which means that you can find an SSID named **RAK72XX_YYYY** on your PC's Wi-Fi Network List. **XX** is the code of your chosen WisGate Edge Gateway and **YYYY** is the last two bytes of the gateway's MAC address.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 No password is required to connect via Wi-Fi
:::

Using your preferred Web browser, log in with the credentials provided below:

- **Browser Address**: 192.168.230.1
- **Username**: root
- **Password**: root

##### WAN Port (Ethernet)

Connect the Ethernet cable to the port marked ETH on the gateway and the other end to the PoE port of the PoE injector. Connect the LAN port of the PoE injector to your PC.

The default IP is **169.254.X.X.** The last two segments (X.X) are mapped from the last four bits of the MAC address of your gateway.

For example, the last four bits of the MAC address are 0F:01, and the IP address is 169.254.15.1. Make sure to manually set the address of your PC to one in the same network (for example 169.254.15.100). Use the same credentials for the Web UI as for AP mode.

#### Hardware Setup

The RAK4631 will not work without a WisBlock Base board. The WisBlock Base provides a USB connection for programming the RAK4631. It also provides a power source and various interfaces to RAK4631 so that it can be connected to other WisBlock modules via different module slots.

RAKwireless offers many [WisBlock Base Boards](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) compatible with WisBlock Core. It is highly recommended for you to look on these WisBlock Base boards to see what matches your requirements in terms of available module slots, power supply options, and overall size.

To illustrate, RAK4631 can be connected to RAK5005-O WisBlock Base, as shown in **Figure 27**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/RAK5005-connect.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="RAK4631 Connection to WisBlock Base RAK5005-O"
/>

There are few pins that are exposed on RAK5005-O, and you can easily use them via header pins. The labels are at the back, as shown in **Figure 28**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/IO-pins.png"
  width="35%"
  caption="WisBlock Base exposed pins"
/>

More information can be found on the [official documentation of the specific WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) you used in your project.

For RAK5005-O WisBlock Base with RAK4631 WisBlock Core, the accessible GPIO pins are defined as follows in the Arduino IDE and Platform IO:

- `WB_IO1` for IO1 pin
- `WB_IO2` for IO2 pin (Also used to control the 3.3&nbsp;V supply of some WisBlock Modules to achieve low-power IoT devices.)
- `WB_A0` for AIN

There are usable LEDs as well that can be controlled by the RAK4631 on the WisBlock Base board:

- `LED_GREEN`
- `LED_BLUE`

UART1 and I2C_1 are also exposed on the header of the WisBlock Base board.

- RAK4631 has a native USB peripheral onboard (Serial), which is used for programming and Serial debugging and two usable hardware **UART1** and **UART2** (Serial 1 and Serial 2). **UART1** is accessible to WisBlock Slot A, WisBlock IO slot, and the exposed header pins. **UART2** is accessible only on the WisBlock IO slot.
- The **I2C_1** header pins are as well shared to the WisBlock Base Slots A to D. The second **I2C_2** is available only on the WisBlock IO slot.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

**Figure 29** shows how to mount the RAK4631 module on top of a WisBlock Base board (RAK5005-O). Follow carefully the procedure defined in [WisBlock module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) in order to secure the connection safely. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws depending on the module.

  caption="RAK4631 Mounting Sketch"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/16.removing-screws.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1910/quickstart/17.detaching-silkscreen.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module"

This section explains the default settings and how to configure them.

1. Setup the region.

Default is **EU868**.

```c
LoRaMacRegion_t g_CurrentRegion = LORAMAC_REGION_EU868;
```

You can change this to a region that is applicable to you like `LORAMAC_REGION_US915`, `LORAMAC_REGION_AU915`, etc.

2. Setup the activation method.

Default is **OTAA**.

```c
bool doOTAA = true;
```

To configure the device to ABP, you need to make this boolean variable `false`.

3. Setup the message type if confirmed or not.

Default is **confirmed message**.

```c
lmh_confirm g_CurrentConfirm = LMH_CONFIRMED_MSG;
```
You can change to unconfirmed message by changing the value to `LMH_UNCONFIRMED_MSG`.

4. Setup device class.

Default is **Class A**.

```c
DeviceClass_t g_CurrentClass = CLASS_A;
```

You can change this to `CLASS_B` (still under development) or `CLASS_C`.

5. Setup the EUIs and KEY. Get these parameters from the [Connecting RAK4631 to TTN V3 Application](/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK-Edge-Gateway-Starter-Kit-Guide/#connecting-rak4631-to-ttn-v3-application) section of this guide. It is very important that the EUI and KEY will match the one configured in the TTN application. Otherwise, your device will not be able to connect to the TTN server. In this application, the device is activated via OTAA so you need to configure the Device EUI, Application EUI, and Application Key.


```c
uint8_t nodeDeviceEUI[8] = {0x70, 0xB3, 0xD5, 0x7E, 0xD0, 0x04, 0xAD, 0x3D};
uint8_t nodeAppEUI[8] = {0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00};
uint8_t nodeAppKey[16] = {0x80, 0x3B, 0x4F, 0xE5, 0xCC, 0x76, 0xDF, 0x81, 0x21, 0xC1, 0x27, 0xC4, 0xBB, 0x74, 0x90, 0xF3};
```

##### LoRaWAN Payload

- This LoRaButton Application will send an integer `1` to the LoRaWAN server when the button is pressed. This is set up on the `void loop()` function.

```c
int stat=digitalRead(WB_IO1);
  if(!stat){
    send_lora_frame();
    delay(5000);
  }
```

- This is set up on the `void send_lora_frame(void)` function. The data will be sent to the LoRaWAN Server. The LoRaWAN payload is packaged in this function.

```c
 if (lmh_join_status_get() != LMH_SET)
  {
    //Not joined, try again later
    return;
  }

  uint32_t i = 0;
  memset(m_lora_app_data.buffer, 0, LORAWAN_APP_DATA_BUFF_SIZE);
  m_lora_app_data.port = gAppPort;
  m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = 1;
  m_lora_app_data.buffsize = i;

  lmh_error_status error = lmh_send(&m_lora_app_data, g_CurrentConfirm);
  if (error == LMH_SUCCESS)
  {
    count++;
    Serial.printf("lmh_send ok count %d\n", count);
  }
  else
  {
    count_fail++;
    Serial.printf("lmh_send fail count %d\n", count_fail);
  }
```


##### Uploading the Arduino Code

After all the configuration is done and the payload is already formatted properly, you can now compile and upload the code.

:::tip üìù NOTE
On the other hand, if the error is related to the difficulty of uploading the FW, try to double click the reset button on the WisBlock Base board and reupload it again.
:::

With the LoRaButton code successfully uploaded, you can now try to press the button on your device that you set up earlier.

Then check again your The Things Stack account and go to **Applications** > `name of your application` > **Live Data**. Wait for the uplink LoRaWAN payload every time you will press the button.
