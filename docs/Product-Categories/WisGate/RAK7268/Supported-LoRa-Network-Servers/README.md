# RAK7268 Supported LoRa Network Servers

## AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN

If you don‚Äôt have an AWS account, refer to the instructions in the guide [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/setting-up.html).  The relevant sections are Sign up for an AWS account and Create a user and grant permissions.

### Overview

The high-level steps to get started with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN are as follows:
1.	Onboard your Gateway (see section [Add the Gateway to AWS IoT](#add-the-gateway-to-aws-iot))
2.	Onboard your Device(s) (see section[ Add a LoRaWAN Device to AWS IoT](#add-a-lorawan-device-to-aws-iot))
  a.	Verify device and service profiles
  b.	Set up a Destination to which device traffic will be routed and processed by a rule.

These steps are detailed below.  For additional details, refer to the [AWS LoRaWAN developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan.html).


### Add the Gateway to AWS IoT

#### Preparation

Refer to the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-onboard-gateways.html) for steps required prior to onboarding your gateway.  For more details check the datasheet page:  [WisGate Edge Lite 2 Datasheet Software](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7268/Datasheet/#software).

#### Frequency Band selection and Role setup

Refer to the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-rfregion-permissions.html) for information on selecting an appropriate frequency band.

::: tip üìù NOTE
LoRa Frequency bands supported by RAK7248: IN865, EU868, US915, AU915, KR920, and AS923.
Select an appropriate frequency band from our Store
:::

Follow the instructions in the section Add an IAM role to allow the Configuration and Update Server (CUPS) to manage gateway credentials in the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-rfregion-permissions.html).

#### Add the LoRaWAN Gateway

To register the Gateway with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN, follow the steps in this [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-onboard-gateway-add.html) under the section Add a gateway using the console.


### Add a LoRaWAN Device to AWS IoT

#### Preparation

- Refer to the datasheet to learn more about [RAK4631 WisBlock LPWAN Module](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631/Datasheet/#overview).
- Refer to the instructions in the section Before onboarding your wireless device in the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-onboard-end-devices.html).
- Then follow the instructions in the section Add your wireless device to AWS IoT Core for [LoRaWAN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-end-devices-add.html).


#### Verify Profiles

AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN supports device profiles and service profiles. Device profiles contain the communication and protocol parameter values the device needs to communicate with the network server. Service profiles describe the communication parameters the device needs to communicate with the application server.

Some pre-defined profiles are available for device and service profiles. Before proceeding, verify that these profile settings match the devices you will be setting up to work with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN.  For more details, refer to the section Add profiles to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN in the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-define-profiles.html).

#### Set up a Destination for Device Traffic

Because most LoRaWAN devices don't send data to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN in a format that can be consumed by AWS services, traffic must first be sent to a Destination.  A Destination represents the AWS IoT rule that processes a device's data for use by AWS services.  This AWS IoT rule contains the SQL statement that selects the device's data and the topic rule actions that send the result of the SQL statement to the services that will use it.

For more information, refer to the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-create-destinations.html) (sections titled Add a destination using the console and Create an IAM role for your destinations).  Also refer to Create rules to process LoRaWAN device messages in the [online guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan-destination-rules.html).

- **Port** ‚Äì The LNS Server uses port 8887. Type in **8887**.
- **Authentication Mode** ‚Äì Choose **TLS server authentication and Client token**. When selected, the trust and the token field will show up.
- **trust** ‚Äì For trust we will use the **Let‚Äôs Encrypt ISRG ROOT X1 Trust** certificate. The file with the certificate can be found [here](https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.pem).
- **token** -  This is the generated **API key**. The key must start with **Authorization:**. Example:

```
Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY
```

::: tip üìù NOTE
Replace **YOUR_API_KEY** with the key generated previously. Have in mind that there should be a ‚Äúspace‚Äù between **Authorization:** and **YOUR_API_KEY**, as shown in the example.
