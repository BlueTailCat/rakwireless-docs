# Soil pH Monitoring Sensor Hub Solutions User Manual

## Overview

Sensor Hub pH Value Monitoring is widely used in applications requiring ph monitoring, such as soil ph measurement to determine soil fertility. The product can be widely used in rice fields, greenhouse cultivation, vegetable cultivation, orchard nursery, flowers, soil research, and more.

The form factor of the Sensor Hub allows for multiple and/or different sensors to be connected at the same time, creating a full and versatile soil condition monitoring system. The Splitter cable can connect several Sensor Probes and Probe IOs to a single Sensor Hub port. The distance between the Sensor Hub and Sensor Probe/Probe IO can be extended via the Extension cable.
