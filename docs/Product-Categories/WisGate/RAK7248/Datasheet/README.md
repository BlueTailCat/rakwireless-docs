#### Circuit Board Modules Stack

The figure below summarizes the basic building blocks of RAK7248. The RAK2287 is an essential part of it as it provides all LoRaWAN connectivity. It receives and transmits LoRa Frames and takes care of modulating/demodulating the signals among others. The processing of the LoRa Frames as well as higher-level protocol-related tasks is done by the embedded host system (Raspberry Pi). Received and processed LoRa Frames are being sent to a LoRaWAN Server. The segmentation of protocol-related tasks is outside the scope of this document.
