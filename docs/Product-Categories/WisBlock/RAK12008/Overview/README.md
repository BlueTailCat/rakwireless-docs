## Product Description

RAK12008 is a WisBlock CO2 Sensor Module that extends the WisBlock system with a Sensirion STC31 CO2 Sensor. The CO2 concentration data is interfaced via I2C. The STC31 sensor from Sensirion is based on thermal conductivity.

A ready-to-use software library and tutorial is included, making it simple to build a CO2 gas data acquisition system for high CO2 concentrations. Additionally, it can be mounted to the sensor slot of the WisBlock Base board.
