## Location

In the context of WisDM‚Äôs structure, location is a logical entity that defines how the gateways are connected to the LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS). It groups the gateways according to their LoRaWAN connectivity.

### Adding a Location

You can add a location by clicking the **New Location** button.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisdm/7.subscription-plan.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="General information"
/>

Then fill in the following information:

- **Location name** ‚Äì a name of your choice, up to 50 characters.
- **Location address** ‚Äì you can copy the organization address or set a new one, either by typing the address in the search bar or by choosing it from the map on the right.
- **Location email settings** ‚Äì you will be notified when there is any change in the gateway‚Äôs activity.
  <rk-img
    src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisdm/8.email-notif.png"
    width="80%"
    caption="Email notifications"
  />
- **Enable/disable** ‚Äì enable or disable the email notifications.
- **Instantly** ‚Äì when choosing this option, you will be notified immediately of any activity.
- **Hourly** ‚Äì you will be notified once an hour.
- **Daily** ‚Äì you will be notified once a day.

The next step is to do the network configuration. You can choose an existing template if there is such.

The location can be set to work in three modes, depending on the user‚Äôs needs. The modes are **Packet forwarder**, **Basics station**, and **Built-In network server**.

### LoRaWAN Network Configuration

After choosing the work mode and the band that the location will operate on, configure the following settings:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisdm/9.network-configuration.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Network configuration"
/>

- **Work Mode** ‚Äì choose the work mode in which they want the location to operate.
- **Frequency Plan** ‚Äì choose the band that is suitable for the gateways and the country of residence.
- **Supported channel number** ‚Äì  choose the number of the channels according to how many channels the gateway that will be added to that location supports.
  :::tip üìù NOTE
  The 16-channel gateways can be added to any location, but an 8-channel gateway can be added only to 8-channel locations.
  :::
- **UDP protocol parameters**
- **Templates** ‚Äì can save the network configuration as a template to use when adding locations in the future.

The further configurations for the three possible work modes differ in the following ways:

#### Location in Packet Forwarder Work Mode

If you opt for advanced frequency options, you will see the following options:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisdm/10.frequency-settings.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Advanced frequency settings"
/>

By choosing the channel plan, the fields related to the frequency configuration of the location and the gateways registered are automatically configured based on the LoRaWAN specification.

#### Basics Station Work Mode

When creating a new location in Basics Station work mode, you need to set up the following configurations:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisdm/11.basics-station.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Location in Basics Station work mode"
/>

- **Basics station server setup** ‚Äì  in this part, you need to input the **Server URL** and the **server port number** of the LoRa Network Server (LNS) to which the gateways will forward the LoRaWAN messages. You have the option to input the LNS server's address directly or choose **CUPS** mode, which will update the LNS address and parameters dynamically.
- **Authentication mode** -  to strengthen the connection security to the LNS, you can choose from different authentication methods - TLS server authentication, TLS server and Client authentication, TLS server authentication, and client token.


#### Location in Built-In Network Server Work Mode

When creating a new location in built-in network server work mode, you need to set up the following configurations:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisdm/12.network-server.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Location in built-in network server work mode"
/>

**Network Server** - By default, the settings are pre-filled. For more details, you can check the guide for setting the WisDM location in built-in work mode.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisdm/13.drop-down.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Network server drop-down menu"
/>

**Disable frame-counter validate** - The frame-counting provides an additional layer of security between the end devices and the LoRa network server. Disabling the frame-counter validation should be done only in specific cases and on the user's own responsibility.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisdm/14.gateway-backend.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Gateway backend drop-down menu"
/>

**Gateway backend** - By default, the gateway backend is set to use the embedded MQTT broker in the gateway. If needed, the user can set up an external MQTT broker or use the provided topics to share the network server data with external clients.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisdm/15.integration-interface.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Integration interface drop-down menu"
/>

**Integration interface** ‚Äì The Built-in network server provides integration to share the data of registered end devices for post-processing to third-party services.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisdm/16.integration-enabled.png"
  width="100%"

  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisdm/18.gateway-information.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Adding gateway information"
/>

- **Unassigned gateways** ‚Äì unassigned gateways are gateways that you remove from the location. Read more on the [FAQ](https://support.wisdm.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/4414740675607-What-are-assigned-and-unassigned-gateways-) page.
- **Upload CSV** ‚Äì  use a comma-separated value document to import the required information for several gateways simultaneously.
- **Add a gateway** ‚Äì add gateways to the location.
- **Serial Number** ‚Äì can be found on the back of the gateway
- **Gateway EUI** ‚Äì can be found on the WisGate OS web page. **Status>overview>system>gateway EUI**

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisdm/19.gateway-availability.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Available and unavailable gateways"
/>

<br> Status of the onboarding gateway: <br>

- If the gateway is connected to the internet with the WisDM agent turned on, and the UI and serial number are correct, it will appear in the **Available gateways**.

- If any of the mentioned requirements are not completed, the gateway will appear as **Unavailable gateways**. The tooltip next to the unavailable gateway line will suggest the possible reason why the gateway is not successfully onboarded.

- The steps to add a gateway to a location in packet forwarder or Basics Station work modes are the same.

- To add a gateway to a location in built-in network server work mode, you need to follow the steps and choose if the gateway will be added as a central and work as a network server.

#### Assigned and Unassigned Gateways

Assigned gateways are gateways you put to work inside WisDM by adding them to a location. Below is the primary flow to help you understand more about assigned and unassigned gateways.

When you add a gateway to WisDM, you add it to a location. Without specifying a location, you cannot add a gateway. Once you‚Äôve specified the location and added them, you have an assigned gateway.

Unassigned gateways are gateways that you remove from the location. Removing them means they are not actively working for you but remain within the organization for you to assign to a location later.
