## Product Description

**RAK3272S Breakout Board** is specifically designed to allow easy access to the pins on the board to simplify development and testing. The breakout board footprint allows the RAK3172 stamp module pins to be transferred to 2.54&nbsp;mm headers.

The board itself has the RAK3172 at its core, integrating a **STM32WLE5CC** chip. It has an ultra-low power consumption of 1.69&nbsp;uA in sleep mode.

This module complies with Class A, B, and C of LoRaWAN 1.0.3 specifications. It also supports LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communication mode, which helps you in implementing your own customized LoRa network quickly.
