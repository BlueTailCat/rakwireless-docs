#### Lightning Protection

In this section, how to set up a lightning surge protection system, whether your RAK7289 WisGate Edge Pro is situated outdoor or indoor, will be discussed. Such a protection system must be taken into consideration to ensure a fully functional gateway without interruption or damage from the lighting.   

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7289/quickstart/10.lightning-protection.jpg"
  width="90%"
  caption="Full lightning protection set-up"
/>

##### Outdoor Surge Protection System

- **Antenna Grounding** - RAKwireless recommends a lightning arrestor to be installed on all the antenna N-type terminals. The arrestors have to be N-type Female to Male to fit the antenna and enclosure connectors. Make sure you use a 10 AWG or better wire to connect the screw terminals of the arrestors to the grounding rail mounted on the building wall (grounding bar in case of field deployment).
  
- **Gateway Grounding** - Additionally, it is recommended to use another 10 AWG or better grounding wire to connect the screw terminal on the bottom left side of the gateway casing to the grounding rail (bar).

:::tip üìù NOTE

No additional protection for the Ethernet cabling is required at the gateway side. There is a surge protection system built in (GDT + Anti-surge resistor).   

:::


:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

Should you fail to adhere to the recommendations in this document RAKwireless carries no responsibility for any damage your equipment incurs due to a lightning strike.

### Access the Gateway

In this section, several ways of accessing the gateway are provided to have different alternatives for you to choose from depending on the availability of the requirements needed.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

Do not power the device if the LoRa antenna port has been left open to avoid potential damage to the RAK7289 WisGate Edge Pro.

::: 


#### Wi-Fi AP Mode

By default, the gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode, which means that you can find an SSID, named **RAK7289_XXXX** on your PC's Wi-Fi network list. "XXXX" is the last two bytes of the gateway's MAC address. 

1. To access the Web Management Platform, input the following IP Address in your Web browser: `192.168.230.1`.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7289/quickstart/13.access-the-gateway.jpg"
  width="70%"
  caption="Accessing the gateway via Wi-Fi AP mode"
/>



:::tip üìù NOTE

No password is required to connect via Wi-Fi.

:::

2. Using your preferred Web browser, input the aforementioned IP address and you should see the Login Page. Login with the provided credentials.

- **Username:** root
- **Password:** root

#### WAN Port (Ethernet)

1. Connect the Ethernet cable to the port marked **ETH** on the gateway and the other end to the PoE port of the PoE injector. Connect the LAN port of the PoE injector to your PC. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7289/quickstart/15.wan-port.jpg"
  width="70%"
  caption="Accessing the gateway via WAN Port (Ethernet)"
/>

2. The default IP is **169.254.X.X**, where the last two segments are mapped from the last four bits of the MAC address of your gateway. For example, the last four bits of the MAC address are 0F:01 and the IP address is 169.254.15.1. Make sure to manually set the address of your PC to one in the same network (for example 169.254.15.100). 

3. To do this, open the head to the **Ethernet Properties** and click the **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**.
