:::

##### Access the Gateway

In this section, several ways of accessing the gateway are provided to have different alternatives for you to choose from depending on the availability of the requirements needed.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Do not power the device if the LoRa Antenna port has been left open to avoid potential damage to the RAK7268/RAK7268C WisGate Edge Lite 2.
:::

##### Wi-Fi AP Mode

By default, the gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode which means that you can find an SSID named **RAK72XX_YYYY** on your PC's Wi-Fi Network List. **XX** is the code of your chosen WisGate Edge Gateway and **YYYY** is the last two bytes of the gateway's MAC address.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 No password is required to connect via Wi-Fi
:::

Using your preferred Web browser, log in with the credentials provided below:

- **Browser Address**: 192.168.230.1
- **Username**: root
- **Password**: root

##### WAN Port (Ethernet)

Connect the Ethernet cable to the port marked ETH on the gateway and the other end to the PoE port of the PoE injector. Connect the LAN port of the PoE injector to your PC.

The default IP is **169.254.X.X.** The last two segments (X.X) are mapped from the last four bits of the MAC address of your gateway.

For example, the last four bits of the MAC address are 0F:01, and the IP address is 169.254.15.1. Make sure to manually set the address of your PC to one in the same network (for example 169.254.15.100). Use the same credentials for the Web UI as for AP mode.

#### Creating Environment Monitoring Application

##### Hardware Setup

This step of the guide is about the actual device configuration.

RAK1906 WisBlock Environmental Sensor module can be connected to any slot of `RAK5005-O WisBlock Base Board` to communicate with the `RAK4631 WisBlock LPWAN Module`. It will work on **SLOT A to D**. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1906/quickstart/rak1906_assembly.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="RAK1906 connection to WisBlock Base"
/>

##### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

###### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 28**, the location for Slot A, B, C, and D are properly marked by silkscreen. Slots C and D are located on the bottom of WisBlock Base. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [RAK5005-O module assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with an M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screw.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1906/quickstart/wisblock-sensor-silkscreen.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="RAK1906 connection to WisBlock Base"
/>

###### Disassembling

The procedure in disassembling any type of WisBlock modules is the same.

1. First, remove the screws.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1906/quickstart/removing-screws.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. Once the screws are removed, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1906/quickstart/detaching-silkscreen.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Detaching silkscreen on the WisBlock module"
/>

3. Apply force to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 31**, to detach the module from the baseboard.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak1906/quickstart/detaching-module.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Applying even forces on the proper location of a WisBlock module"
/>

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) tool for possible conflicts. RAK1906 uses I2C communication lines, and it can cause possible conflict especially on some IO modules.
:::

##### LoRa and BLE Antenna

Another important part component of RAK4631 is the antennas.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/lora-antenna.png"
  width="30%"
  caption="LoRa Antenna"
/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/ble-antenna.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="BLE Antenna"
/>

You need to ensure that the antenna is properly connected to have a good LoRa signal. Do not power the module without an antenna connected to the IPEX connector to avoid damage to the RF section of the chip.

RAK4631 has a label on its sticker where to connect the antennas, as shown in **Figure 34**.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak4631/quickstart/RAK4631-antenna-label.png"

/>

:::tip üìù NOTE
Detailed information about the RAK4631 BLE and LoRa antenna can be found on the [antenna datasheet](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/#LoRa/WisBlock/Accessories/).
:::

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
When using the LoRa or Bluetooth Low Energy transceivers, make sure that an antenna is always connected. Using these transceivers without an antenna can damage the system. Make sure to fix the module with the screws to ensure a proper function.
:::

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming the RAK1906.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- Battery can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the RAK WisBlock Base Board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
:::

#### Software Setup

The RAK1906 is a 4-in-1 Environmental Sensor board that contains the Bosch BME680 chip. It is specially designed for wearables where size and low power consumption are critical requirements. The BME680 contains a small Metal-Oxide (MOX) sensor and an I2C interface used to communicate with WisBlock Core.

The RAK1906 module gives information about:
- Air pressure
- Air quality
- Ambient Air Temperature
- Environment Humidity

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
The BME680 requires a burn-in period to collect accurate readings. The burn-in procedure can be achieved by reading all sensors once every 5 seconds for at least 20 minutes the first time that you use it. For each subsequent use, the readings should stabilize 2-3 minutes after power-up.
:::

##### Software Configuration

1. Download the (Arduino IDE)[https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), then install it on your PC or laptop.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
_**If you are using Windows 10**_.

##### Configuring LoRaWAN

Before uploading the Arduino Code, there are configurations that you need to set up to ensure that the device can join a LoRaWAN Network server.

The steps below will explain the default settings and how to configure them.

1. Set up the LoRa Region.

Default region is **EU868**.

```c
LoRaMacRegion_t g_CurrentRegion = LORAMAC_REGION_EU868;
```

You can change this to a region that is applicable to you like `LORAMAC_REGION_US915`, `LORAMAC_REGION_AU915`, etc.

2. Set up the LoRaWAN activation method.

Default is **OTAA**.

```c
bool doOTAA = true;
```

To configure the device to ABP, you need to make this boolean variable `false`.

3. Set up the message type if confirmed or not.

Default is **confirmed message**.

```c
lmh_confirm g_CurrentConfirm = LMH_CONFIRMED_MSG;
```

You can change to unconfirmed message by changing the value to `LMH_UNCONFIRMED_MSG`.

4. Set up device class.

Default is **Class A**.

```c
DeviceClass_t g_CurrentClass = CLASS_A;
```

You can change this to **CLASS_B** (still under development) or **CLASS_C**.

5. Setup the EUIs and KEY. Get these parameters from the [Connecting RAK4631 to TTN V3 Application](/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK-Edge-Gateway-Kit-4-Guide/#connecting-rak4631-to-ttn-v3-application) section of this guide. It is very important that the EUI and KEY will match the one configured in the TTN application. Otherwise, your device will not be able to connect to the TTN server. In this application, the device is activated via OTAA so you need to configure the Device EUI, Application EUI, and Application Key.

```c
uint8_t nodeDeviceEUI[8] = {0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x33, 0x33};
uint8_t nodeAppEUI[8] = {0xB8, 0x27, 0xEB, 0xFF, 0xFE, 0x39, 0x00, 0x00};
uint8_t nodeAppKey[16] = {0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88, 0x88};
```

6. Set up uplink period.

The default is **20000&nbsp;mS**.

```c
#define LORAWAN_APP_INTERVAL 20000
```


##### LoRaWAN Payload

- This is the setup on the `void send_lora_frame(void)` function.

```c
if (lmh_join_status_get() != LMH_SET)
{
  //Not joined, try again later
  return;
}
if (!bme.performReading()) {
  return;
}
bme680_get();

lmh_error_status error = lmh_send(&m_lora_app_data, g_CurrentConfirm);
if (error == LMH_SUCCESS)
{
  count++;
  Serial.printf("lmh_send ok count %d\n", count);
}
else
{
  count_fail++;
  Serial.printf("lmh_send fail count %d\n", count_fail);
}
```

- This is the setup on the `void bme680_get()` function. This will gather the data from the sensor and package them in a LoRaWAN payload.

```c
char oled_data[32] = {0};
Serial.print("result: ");
uint32_t i = 0;
memset(m_lora_app_data.buffer, 0, LORAWAN_APP_DATA_BUFF_SIZE);
m_lora_app_data.port = gAppPort;

double temp = bme.temperature;
double pres = bme.pressure / 100.0;
double hum = bme.humidity;
uint32_t gas = bme.gas_resistance;

data = "Tem:" + String(temp) + "C " + "Hum:" + String(hum) + "% " + "Pres:" + String(pres) + "KPa " + "Gas:" + String(gas) + "Ohms";
Serial.println(data);

// display bme680 sensor data on OLED
u8g2.clearBuffer();         // clear the internal memory
u8g2.setFont(u8g2_font_ncenB10_tr); // choose a suitable font

memset(oled_data, 0, sizeof(oled_data));
sprintf(oled_data, "T=%.2fC", temp);
u8g2.drawStr(3, 15, oled_data);

memset(oled_data, 0, sizeof(oled_data));
snprintf(oled_data, 64, "RH=%.2f%%", hum);
u8g2.drawStr(3, 30, oled_data);

memset(oled_data, 0, sizeof(oled_data));
sprintf(oled_data, "P=%.2fhPa", pres);
u8g2.drawStr(3, 45, oled_data);

memset(oled_data, 0, sizeof(oled_data));
sprintf(oled_data, "G=%dOhms", gas);
u8g2.drawStr(3, 60, oled_data);

u8g2.sendBuffer(); // transfer internal memory to the display

uint16_t t = temp * 100;
uint16_t h = hum * 100;
uint32_t pre = pres * 100;

//result: T=28.25C, RH=50.00%, P=958.57hPa, G=100406 Ohms
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = 0x01;
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)(t >> 8);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)t;
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)(h >> 8);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)h;
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((pre & 0xFF000000) >> 24);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((pre & 0x00FF0000) >> 16);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((pre & 0x0000FF00) >> 8);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)(pre & 0x000000FF);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((gas & 0xFF000000) >> 24);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((gas & 0x00FF0000) >> 16);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)((gas & 0x0000FF00) >> 8);
m_lora_app_data.buffer[i++] = (uint8_t)(gas & 0x000000FF);
m_lora_app_data.buffsize = i;
```

12. Ubidots `The Things Stack` default decoder supports the payload format of RAK1906 so there is no need for further decoder configuration. This is the section of the Ubidots decoder that gets the sensor values. Since this decoder is already in Ubidots, no extra decoder is needed in the TTN application console.

```js
function decodeUplink(bytes) {
  // Decoder for the RAK1906 WisBlock Environmental Sensor (https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak1906-bme680-environment-sensor)
  var decoded = {};
  if (bytes[0] == 1) {
      // If received data is of Environment Monitoring type
      decoded.temperature = (bytes[1] << 8 | (bytes[2])) / 100;
      decoded.humidity = (bytes[3] << 8 | (bytes[4])) / 100;
      decoded.pressure = (bytes[8] | (bytes[7] << 8) | (bytes[6] << 16) | (bytes[5] << 24)) / 100;
      decoded.gas = bytes[12] | (bytes[11] << 8) | (bytes[10] << 16) | (bytes[9] << 24);
  }
  return {"data": decoded};
}
```

13. Go back to The Things Stack account and **Go to applications**.
