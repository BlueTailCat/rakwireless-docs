## Solution Description

The Water Level Monitor Sensor Solution is an ideal tool for monitoring water levels. It comprises the RAK Sensor Hub and ULB16 sensor, which is suitable for use in various settings, such as hydrology exploration, water tank level measurements, and sewage. 

With the plug-and-play feature of the Sensor Hub, the Water Level Solution comes with pre-installed components ready for easy installation and connection. The sensor provides highly accurate water level readings, with the Sensor Hub collecting and transmitting the data via LoRaWAN or NB-IoT/CAT M1.

The Sensor Hubâ€™s connectivity function allows for versatile data transmission to the cloud using the two most commonly used communication protocols in IoT. This versatility ensures that data is readily available for storage, visualization, and in-depth analysis, enabling informed decision-making based on comprehensive knowledge of water levels.
