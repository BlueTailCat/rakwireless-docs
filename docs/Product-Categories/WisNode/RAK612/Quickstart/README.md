## Product Configuration

### Interfacing with RAK612 WisNode Button

In order for you to be able to interface with the RAK612 WisNode Button with your Windows Machine, you need to download the [RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/LoRa/Tools/RAK_SERIAL_PORT_TOOL_V1.2.1.zip).

1. Using a standard **Micro - USB Cable**, connect your RAK612 WisNode Button to your computer.

:::tip üìù NOTE
If this is your first time to connect your RAK612 WisNode Button to your computer, it should automatically download the CH340 driver in order for them to communicate properly. Make sure to have an internet access if you want such automatic installation to be successful. If such process fails, re-plug your Micro - USB cord and proceed to the next step.
:::

2. Go to your **Device Manager** by pressing : **Windows + R** and type `devmgmt.msc` or **search in Start Menu** or right click "**My Computer**" or "**This PC**" and click **Manage**. Look for **Other Devices.**
