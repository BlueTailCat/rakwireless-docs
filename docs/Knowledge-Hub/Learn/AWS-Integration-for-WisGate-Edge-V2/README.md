# AWS Integration for WisGate Edge V2

## Overview

### Description

AWS IoT Core Integration is a software service that enables your LoRaWAN gateway to work with AWS IoT Core. This document will show you how to set up a LoRaWAN end-node and view its data on the AWS IoT Console. In addition, it‚Äôll show you how to send a message from AWS IoT Console to the end-node as well.

### Prerequisites

- A gateway from the RAK WisGate Edge V2 series
- A node from the RAK WisNode or WisBlock series, or another LoRaWAN-compatible node
- An [AWS account](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fconsole%2Fhome%3Ffromtb%3Dtrue%26hashArgs%3D%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue%26nc2%3Dh_ct%26src%3Dheader-signin%26state%3DhashArgsFromTB_us-east-1_a53fa9852547e0dd&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Asignin%3A%3A%3Aconsole%2Fcanvas&forceMobileApp=0&code_challenge=pdxKQdhyX4lCmF3_dH3QBzFZ_lvpvhTprqWNAcHrtlk&code_challenge_method=SHA-256))

:::tip üìù NOTE
For this tutorial, the RAK7204 WisNode Sense is used as the end-node, and RAK7268V2 WisGate Edge Lite 2 is for the gateway.
:::

### Set Up Environment for Evaluation

#### Set Up the Build-in Network Server

All WisGate Edge V2 gateways are pre-configured in the Network Server mode of operation. If you want to make modifications, create the application, and add the device needed for this demonstration, refer to the [WisGate OS 2 User Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Software-APIs-and-Libraries/WisGateOS-2/Overview/#built-in-network-server-mode-settings/). It shows the details of the Built-in Network server configuration.

#### Integrate AWS IoT Core

AWS IoT Core is a cloud-based service that connects your "things" (devices, sensors, etc.) to other devices and AWS cloud services. AWS IoT provides software that can help you integrate your IoT devices into AWS IoT-based solutions. If your devices can connect to AWS IoT, AWS IoT can connect them to the cloud services that AWS provides.

##### Create a Thing

1. To create a thing (add a device), in the AWS IoT console, navigate to **All devices** > **Things** and select **Create Things.**

  width="100%"
  caption="Things Tab in the AWS IoT Console"
/>

2. You can choose to add a single device or multiple ones. For this demonstration, select **Create single thing** and click **Next**.

  width="100%"
  caption="Configure Device Certificate"

5. A policy is needed for your thing. Click **Create policy**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/aws-integration-for-wisgate-edge-v2/5.attach-policies.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Attach Policies to Certificate"

6. You‚Äôll be automatically redirected to **Secirity** > **Policies** in a new window.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/knowledge-hub/learn/aws-integration-for-wisgate-edge-v2/6.create-policy.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Create a Policy"
/>

7. Fill in the following fields, then click **Create**.

- **Name**: A name for your policy. For this example, the name will be `My_policy`.
- **Policy effect**: Mark **Allow**.
- **Policy action**: Choose `*` for all actions.
- **Policy resource**: Type `*`.

8. Return to the previous window and refresh it by clicking the **Refresh** button. You will then see the newly created policy pop up in the list. Choose it and click **Create Thing**.

  width="100%"
  caption="Attach Policies to Certificate"

9. In the opened window, download all the certificates and keys, then click **Done**.

:::tip üìù NOTE
Save the downloaded certificates and keys, as they cannot be downloaded again if needed.

10. Your thing is created.

##### Configure Global Integration for the AWS Proxy

1. Now, you need to configure the global integration of the gateway for the AWS IoT Core. To do so, in the gateway's Web UI, navigate to **LoRa** > **Configuration** > **Integration Interface Parameters**. Click on **Enable Integration Interface** and choose **AWS IoT Core** for the **Integration Mode**.

  width="100%"
  caption="Application Server Integration"
/>

2. Fill in the following information:

- **AWS URL** - The URL for your things can be found in the **Settings** menu under the **Endpoint** in the AWS IoT console.

  width="100%"
  caption="Device Data Endpoint"
/>

- **AWS Port** ‚Äì The port for the AWS IoT core. Fill the field with port `8883`.
- **CA Certificate** ‚Äì The certificate you've downloaded (see Figure 15).
- **Vendor Certificate** ‚Äì The certificate you've downloaded (see Figure 15).
- **Vendor Key** ‚Äì The key you've downloaded (see Figure 15).

/>

### Verify a Successful Integration

- <b> See messages from the device in the AWS IoT console </b>

1. To see the messages from the end-node, navigate to the **Test** > **MQTT test client** tab in the AWS IoT console.

  width="100%"
  caption="Test tab"
/>

2. In the **Subscription topic** field, subscribe to all topics by typing `#` to see the data (join, uplink, downlinks, etc.) from the node.

  width="100%"
  caption="Messages from the Device"
/>

3. RAKwireless provides a [decoder](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RUI_LoRa_node_payload_decoder) for all WisNode devices that are based on RUI. All WisNode devices support **Cayenne LPP** payload format and it can be activated via the Web UI of the gateway. Navigate to **LoRa** > **Applications** > **Your_application** > **Configuration** > **Payload format**.

4. In the **Payload type** drop-down menu choose **Cayenne LPP**, then enable **Only forward the parsed data object** to receive only the data of the sensor. Click **Save changes**.

  width="100%"
  caption="Payload formats"

- <b> Send messages to the device </b>

1. To send messages to the end-node, in the AWS IoT console, navigate to **Test** > **MQTT test client** > **Publish to a topic**.

   Here you need to fill in the following:

   - **Specify a topic to publish to, e.g. myTopic/1** ‚Äì The name of the topic to which you want to publish a message. Here is a template of the downlink topic the RAK Gateway uses `application/application_name/device/eui/tx`, where:
     - **application_name** ‚Äì This is the name of your application.
     - **eui** ‚Äì This is the device‚Äôs EUI.

   An example of a downlink topic would be `application/My_application/device/60c5a8fffeXXXXXX/tx`.

   - **Message Payload** ‚Äì The message that you want to send to the end-node. It must be in the format `{"confirmed":true,"data":"SGVsbG8=","fPort":10}`, where:
     - **Confirmed** can be true or false.
     - The content of the **data** is the information you want to send. The information must be base64 encoded. This can be done with a [converter](https://www.base64decode.org/).
     - **fPort** is the port number where you send the data. The number can be 1-255.

   You can send the message by clicking **Publish to topic**.

2. The message can be seen in the **Live Device Data** of the node in the Web UI of the gateway.
