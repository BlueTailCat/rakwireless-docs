# RAK9155 Battery Plus Datasheet

## Overview


### Description 

Battery Plus is the RAK's latest battery system incorporating a solar charging system and status monitoring. It is specially developed for the WisGate Edge Pro gateways. It will allow reliable outdoor deployment of the gateway in remote off-grid scenarios where the power is unreliable or inaccessible. Not only your gateway will be powered 24/7 with the solar panel option, but you will get all the battery data and status in the WisGateOS‚Äô Web UI locally, and in the WisDM remotely. With its 50Ah battery, your gateway can run for more than 5 days without sun.

### Features

- **Long Life Span** - The Lithium Iron Phosphate battery can be expected to remain serviceable for more than 10 years, considering that it is charged and discharged once a day at room temperature (25 ¬∞C).  
- **Integrated Heating Function** - The battery integrates a solar charger and heater, it can be connected to PV panels directly and charged under 0 ¬∞C. 
- **Lightweight Design** - The weight of RAK9155 is no more than 8 kg making installation by a single person easier. 
- **High Waterproof Grade** - With IP65 rating of the enclosure, RAK9155 is suitable for both indoor and outdoor environments.
- **Two PV inputs** - One mandatory for primary solar panel and one optional for a second panel, ideal for high-altitude or low-sunlight areas.

#### Environmental Requirements

#### Transportation Requirements

During transportation, it should be protected from severe vibration, shock, sun, and rain, and should not be inverted to ensure that short circuits will not occur. During the loading and unloading process, it should be handled gently to prevent falling, rolling, heavy pressure, and inversion.

#### Storage Requirements

The module is stored in an incompletely charged state, typically around 40% SOC. Product storage environment requirements are as follows:

- Storage temperature: storage time < 3 months, then stored at -30 ¬∞ C ~ 50 ¬∞ C, 40%SOC; Storage time > 3 months, then 0 ~ 25 ¬∞ C, 40%SOC;
- Storage humidity: humidity is 2%RH~ 90%RH, it is recommended to store in the range of no more than 85%RH;
- Storage environment: The product should be stored in a clean, ventilated, and cool environment, avoiding direct sunlight, high temperature, corrosive gas, severe vibration, mechanical shock and heavy pressure; away from heat source; altitude is less than 1500 meters, atmospheric pressure is 86 ~ 106 kPa.
- Maintenance: In a dry and ventilated environment, recharge is required once every 1 month during storage; the maintenance test method during product storage is as follows:
- Under normal temperature conditions, the product is charged and discharged once every month with standard charging. If the module is expected to be stored for more than 30 days, the SOC will be adjusted to 40% after the charging is completed.
- This product must comply with the operating instructions. Any installation, maintenance, and use of this product must strictly comply with the relevant safety regulations.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Do not store or use at high temperatures, and must be kept away from heat. These environments above the safe temperature range can cause significant degradation in the performance and life of the product, and even cause serious consequences such as burning and explosion;
- Storage and use in environments with high static or high electromagnetic radiation are prohibited. Otherwise, the electronic components in this product may be damaged, which may cause safety hazards;
- Do not get wet or even soak in water. Otherwise, it may cause an internal short circuit, loss of function, or abnormal chemical reaction of the product, and cause fire, smoke, explosion, and other accidents;
- If you find any abnormalities in smoking, fever, discoloration or deformation, or use, storage, transportation, and service, you should contact the professional department immediately to further observe and control the risks;
- Do not discard discarded products in fire or hot furnaces. Waste batteries should be recycled and recycled by professional agencies or organizations;
- It is forbidden to press heavy objects on the product or stack them on each other;
- Although the module is not a high-pressure energy storage device, non-professionals and improper operation and use may still cause serious consequences such as burning and explosion. The installation and maintenance of the battery system must be operated by professional technicians. The use must strictly abide by the relevant safety regulations; non-professionals are strictly prohibited to install, and repairing battery systems and abuse.
