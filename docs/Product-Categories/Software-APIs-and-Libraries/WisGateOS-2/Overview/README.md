# WisGate OS 2 User Manual

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT
WisGateOS 2.2 comes with significant updates that affect all extensions, downgrade flow, and others. Read the following critical points carefully:
- **Downgrading Restrictions**: Once you upgrade to WisGateOS 2.2.x, you will not be able to revert to version 2.1.x using the standard downgrade (WebUI). Make sure to back up and secure all critical data before proceeding with the upgrade. Only through a recovery procedure will a downgrade be possible. The steps for the recovery procedure can be found here: [OpenWRT Recovery Procedure](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/OpenWRT-Recovery-Procedure/).
- **Extension Signature Requirement**: All extensions for WisGateOS 2.2.x will now require a signature for increased security and compatibility. Extensions that lack this signature (such as those for WisGateOS 2.0.x/2.1.x) will not be installable on 2.2.x. This ensures that you are running the new firmware with verified and trusted extensions. On WisGateOS 2.2.x, the Extension Gallery will automatically update installed Extensions. Some extensions, such as WireGuard, require manual installation after upgrading to WisGateOS 2.2.x.
- **Internet Connection**: Because the new firmware and Extension gallery require a signature check, an Internet connection is required during the update.
- **Dual Firmware**: Some customers may still be using firmware version 2.1.x. Both versions will be supported, but it is critical to use the correct and corresponding extensions for each version to avoid compatibility issues. We strongly recommend moving to the new WisGateOS 2.2.x to be able to use the latest features, security, and services.

## Overview

This document describes in detail the functionality of the WisGateOS 2. The system builds on top of OpenWRT and runs on all RAK WisGate Edge V2 gateways. The guide presents general overview and provides guides and detailed configuration of the gateway. It functions as reference for several products with similar functionality. Thus, some sections will apply to certain products and not others.



## Gateway Start-up

To power up the gateway, check the Quick Start guide of the respective device. There are two ways to access the gateway (**Wi-Fi AP Mode** and **WAN Port (Ethernet)**) explained in the corresponding document.

::: tip üìù NOTE
Make sure all the antennas are connected before powering the Gateway.
:::


## Access the WisGateOS 2 Web UI

1. For security reasons, upon first login, the user must set a login password. This is done by filling in the desired password and confirming it in the provided fields.

The password needs to comply with the following rules:

- Should be at least 12 characters long;
- Has at least one special character (!‚Äú#$%&\‚Äò()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~);
- Has at least one number;
- Has at least one standard Latin letter (used in the English alphabet).

<rk-img

  width="100%"
  caption="First login page"
/>

2. When the fields are filled in, click the **Set password** button to apply it. The Web UI is now accessible and it will load the **LoRaWAN Statistics** page (Figure 4).

3. On the next login, the user needs to use the set password for access. The default login username is **root**.

  width="100%"
  caption="Login page"
/>

## Web Management Platform

After the user have entered the correct credentials and logged in the gateway, they can start exploring the configuration and monitoring interface of the device starting with the **LoRaWAN Statistics** page that opens automatically.

::: tip üìù NOTE
In WisGateOS 2, the menu names are hidden for esthetic reasons and only the icons are visible.
:::

The user can click on the WisGate logo (<img src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos2/main/a.png"/>) in the upper left corner to expand the menu on the left and see the full names of the tabs. When the user clicks anywhere else on the page, the menu folds again.

  caption="Folded and unfolded sidebar"
/>

### Dashboard

This is where statistics about the gateway behavior can be monitored in real time.

#### LoRaWAN Statistics

The page consists of several blocks where the user can see the overview of some metrics and basic information about the traffic of messages.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/software-apis-and-library/wisgateos2/main/5.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="LoRaWAN Statistics tab"
/>

- **Packets** - Shows the total number of received and transmitted packets by the gateway (uplinks and downlinks). Here are displayed not only messages from devices connected to the gateway directly but from any device that is within the coverage of the gateway and transmitting LoRa messages.
- **End devices** - Shows the number of end devices within the gateway's coverage that sent data:
  - **Active** - The number of the end devices that have sent data in the past hour.
  - **Busy** ‚Äì The number of the end devices that have sent an average of 1 uplink packet every minute in the past 10 minutes.
- **Channel Usage** - Shows the frequency channel load. –¢he green color indicates low load and the red color indicates high load. The user can use the **Timespan** drop-down menu and **Range** scale to set timespan and range for the channel usage to be shown in the graph.

Above the graphs, the user can see the color-coding of the different Data Rates, where the actual height of the values is a sum of all the packets overall data rates for the time sample. The user can set a time span to be shown for the uplink traffic via the **Timespan** drop-down menu.
- **Downlink Traffic** - Shows the packet per minute rate as a function of time and airtime (sec) per minute. Above the graphs, the user can see the color-coding of the different Data Rates, where the actual height of the values is a sum of all the packets overall data rates for the time sample. The user can set a different time span to be shown for the downlink traffic via the **Timespan** drop-down menu.

### Configuration

In the Configuration tab, the user can set the working mode of the gateway. In the **Work mode** setting the user can set the mode to **Packet forwarder**, **Basics station** or **Built-in network server**.

In addition, the user can set the **Log Level** to **Error** (shows only error logs), **Warning** (shows warnings logs), **Notice** (shows notice logs), **Info** ¬≠(shows all notice, error, and warning logs) or **Debug**** (this is full log, it shows all types of logs, it is used for debugging).

Depending on the chosen mode, the other available settings and tabs change. By default, the gateway is configured to work in **Built-in network server**.
