## Product Description

RAK3272S Breakout Board is specifically designed to allow easy access to the pins on the board in order to simplify development and testing. The breakout board footprint is based on the XBee form factor, and its main purpose is to allow the RAK3172 stamp module pins to be transferred to 2.54&nbsp;mm headers.

The board itself has the RAK3172 at its core, integrating a STM32WLE5CC chip. It has Ultra-Low Power Consumption of 1.69&nbsp;uA in sleep mode.

This module complies with Class A, B, & C of LoRaWAN 1.0.3 specifications. It also supports LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communication mode, which helps you in implementing your own customized long-range LoRa network quickly.
