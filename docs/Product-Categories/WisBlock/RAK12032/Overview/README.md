## Product Description

RAK12032 is a WisBlock 3-axis Accelerometer Sensor Module that extends the WisBlock system with an ADXL313 3-axis accelerometer from Analog Devices. It comes with a ready-to-use software library and tutorial, making it easily to build a motion-sensing data acquisition system. The motion-sensing data is interfaced via I2C. Additionally, RAK12032 can be mounted to the sensor slot of the WisBlock Base board.

## Product Features

* **Sensor specifications**
    *  Based on ADXL313
    *  Measurement rangeÔºö+/-0.5g, +/-1g, +/-2g, +/-4g
    *  High resolution (up to 13-bit)
    *  Ultra-low power (scales automatically with data rate), as low as 30&nbsp;uA in measurement mode
    *  Low noise performance: 150&nbsp;ug/Hz typical for X-Y axes
    *  Built-in motion detection functions for activity/inactivity monitoring
    *  I2C digital interfaces
    *  3.3&nbsp;V power supply
    *  Operating temperature range: -40&nbsp;¬∞C to +85&nbsp;¬∞C

* **Size**
    * 10 x 10&nbsp;mm

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK12032**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** provides power supply to the **RAK12032** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to use the sensor.
