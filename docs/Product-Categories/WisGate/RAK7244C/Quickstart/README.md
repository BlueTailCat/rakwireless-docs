## Product Configuration

### Accessing Your Gateway

After burning the firmware image onto the SD Card, make sure you have inserted the SD Card into the **RAK7244C WisGate Developer D4+ Gateway** and have the LoRa and GPS Antenna connected. After which, you can now safely power on the gateway.

In this document, several ways to access the gateway are provided to have different alternatives for you to choose from depending on the availability of the requirements needed.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING
Before powering the Raspberry Pi 4, you should connect the LoRa, GPS, and LTE antennas. Not doing so might damage the boards.
:::

#### 1. Wi-Fi AP Mode

By default, the gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP mode, which means you can find an SSID named "**Rakwireless_XXXX**" on your PC Wi-Fi Network List.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7244c/quickstart/2.accessing-gateway/1.lz4jkwc4hc5bulz0tial.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="RAKwireless access point"
/>

::: tip üìù NOTE:
**XXXX** is the last 2 bytes of your RAK7244C Wi-Fi MAC address. Connect to this Wi-Fi SSID using the password provided below. Take note also of the default IP address of the gateway provided below as this will be needed in connecting via SSH.

- **Wi-Fi Password:** rakwireless
- **Default IP Address:** `192.168.230.1`
  :::

#### 2. Raspberry Pi 4 Ethernet Port

You can also connect your PC with the gateway through an Ethernet cable. By default, the IP address of the gateway‚Äôs Ethernet interface is `192.168.10.10`, so you need to set the IP address of your PC‚Äôs Ethernet to the same network segment, for example, `192.168.10.20`_._

- To do this on a Windows PC, go to **Control Panel -> Network and Internet -> Network and Sharing Center** and **Click Ethernet**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7244c/quickstart/2.accessing-gateway/2.em5xb92hmbrbk6l0k8ta.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Network and sharing center"
/>

- Click **Properties**, then choose **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4).**

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7244c/quickstart/2.accessing-gateway/3.q1fuiang2vcayglvgirm.png"
  width="90%"
