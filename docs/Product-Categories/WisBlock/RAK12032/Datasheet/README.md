### Description

RAK12032 is a WisBlock 3-axis Accelerometer Sensor Module that extends the WisBlock system with an ADXL313 3-axis accelerometer from Analog Devices. It comes with a ready-to-use software library and tutorial, making it easily to build a motion-sensing data acquisition system. The motion-sensing data is interfaced via I2C. Additionally, RAK12032 can be mounted to the sensor slot of the WisBlock Base board.

### Product Features

* **Sensor specifications**
    *  Based on ADXL313
    *  Measurement rangeÔºö+/-0.5g, +/-1g, +/-2g, +/-4g
    *  High resolution (up to 13-bit)
    *  Ultra-low power (scales automatically with data rate), as low as 30&nbsp;uA in measurement mode
    *  Low noise performance: 150&nbsp;ug/Hz typical for X-Y axes
    *  Built-in motion detection functions for activity/inactivity monitoring
    *  I2C digital interfaces
    *  3.3&nbsp;V power supply
    *  Operating temperature range: -40&nbsp;¬∞C to +85&nbsp;¬∞C

* **Size**
    * 10 x 10&nbsp;mm

## Specifications

### Overview

#### Mounting

**Figure 2** shows the mounting mechanism of the RAK12032 module on a [WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/#wisblock-base) board. The RAK12032 module can be mounted on the slots: **C, D, E, & F**.

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into five parts. It shows the chipset of the module and discusses the pinouts, sensors, and the corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical and mechanical parameters that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK12032 WisBlock 3-Axis Sensor.

#### Chipset

| Vendor         | Part Number |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Analog Devices | ADXL313     |

#### Pin Definition

The RAK12032 WisBlock 3-Axis Sensor comprises a standard WisBlock connector. The WisBlock connector allows the RAK12032 module to be mounted to a WisBlock Base board. The pin order of the connector and the pinout definition is shown in **Figure 3**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

The following are connected to WisBlock connector:
  - **I2C**-related pins
  - **INT1**
  - **INT2**
  - **VDD**
  - **GND**

:::

**INT2** pin at **Pin 10** and **INT1** pin at **Pin 12**  will depend on where sensor slot the module is plugged in. The table shows the compatible pins used by different sensor slots:

**INT2 (Interrupt 2 Output Pin)**

| Slot C | Slot D | Slot E | Slot F |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| IO4    | IO6    | IO3    | IO5    |

**INT1 (Interrupt 1 Output Pin)**

| Slot C | Slot D | Slot E | Slot F |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| IO3    | IO5    | IO4    | IO6    |
