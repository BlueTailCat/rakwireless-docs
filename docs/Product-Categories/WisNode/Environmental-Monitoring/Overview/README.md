### Solution Description

The Environmental Monitoring solution offers an effective tool for monitoring temperature and humidity levels, comprising the RAK Sensor Hub and the RAK1901 WisBlock Temperature and Humidity Sensor inside the Sensor Probe. This comprehensive monitoring system is well-suited for various applications, including agricultural greenhouses, incubators, and smart cities.

With the plug-and-play feature of the Sensor Hub, the Environmental Monitoring Solution comes with pre-installed components ready for easy installation and connection. The sensor provides highly accurate temperature and humidity readings, with the Sensor Hub collecting and transmitting the data via LoRaWAN or NB-IoT/CAT M1.

The Sensor Hubâ€™s connectivity function allows for versatile data transmission to the cloud using the two most used communication protocols in IoT. This versatility ensures that data is readily available for storage, visualization, and in-depth analysis, enabling informed decision-making based on comprehensive knowledge of temperature and humidity levels.
