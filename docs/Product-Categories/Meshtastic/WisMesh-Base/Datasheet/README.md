# RAK19026 WisMesh Base Board Datasheet

## Overview

**RAK19026** is a **WisBlock Base Board** that connects **WisBlock IO**, and **WisBlock Modules**. It provides the power supply and interconnection to the modules attached to it.     
Different to other WisBlock Base Boards, it has no Core Slot for a WisBlock Core module. Instead it has a WisDuo RAK4630 integrated as its MCU. Beside of the MCU, a GNSS module and acceleration sensor are as well on the Base Board.
Similar to other WisBlock Base Boards it has three slots B-D for WisBlock modules. The WisBlock modules are attached to the top or bottom side of the RAK19026. The Slot D holds modules up to 23&nbsp;mm in size, while slots B to C support 10&nbsp;mm WisBlock modules. In addtion it has one IO slot for WisBlock IO modules.     

For convenience, there is a USB-C connector that is connected directly to WisDuo MCU‚Äôs USB port. It can be used for uploading firmware or serial communication. The USB-C connector is also used as a battery charging port.

WisBlock modules are connected to the RAK19026 WisBlock Base board via high-speed board-to-board connectors. They provide secure and reliable interconnection to ensure the signal integrity of each data bus. A set of screws are used for fixing the modules, which makes it reliable even in an environment with lots of vibrations.

**RAK19026** has connectors for the following:

* 1 WisBlock modules compatible with IO slot
* 4 WisBlock modules compatible with slots A-D
* 1 Type-C USB port for programming and debugging
* 3.7&nbsp;V Rechargeable battery connector
* 5&nbsp;V Solar panel connector
* Multiple headers with solder contacts
   * 4 pin header with I2C, 3.3V and GND    
   * 4 pin header with IO5, IO6, IO7, and IO8    
   * 5 pin header with IO1, IO3, IO4, 3.3V, and GND    
   * 4 pin header for OLED display with I2C, 3.3V and GND    
   * 5 pin header with SWD, SWCLK, RST, 3.3V, and GND (for programming and debugging with RAKDAP1 or Jlink adapters)    


Additionally, it has two user-definable LEDs, one power supply/charging indicator LED, a reset button, a user-definable button and a battery disconnection switch.

:::tip üìù NOTE
<b>Battery Disconnection Switch</b>

The battery can still be recharged through the USB port or the 5&nbsp;V/Solar panel connector, even if the switch is in OFF position.
:::

If modules require to be placed outside of the WisMesh Base Board, extension cables are available:

#### Connector for WisBlock IO Slot

The WisBlock Module IO Slot connector, as shown in **Figure 13**, is a 40-pin board-to-board connector.

:::tip üìù NOTE
The two WisBlock 40-pin connectors have the same connections for all IO, signal, and serial pins (UART, SPI, I2C).

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
The RAK19026, as any electronic equipment, is sensitive to **electrostatic discharge (ESD)**. Improper handling can cause permanent damage to the module.
:::

##### Current Consumption

The RAK19026 is designed for **low-power IoT products**, and the power supply uses a high-efficiency low grounding current regulator. When there is no module on RAK19026, the **leakage current is lower than 2 ¬µA**. With WisBlock Core and WisBlock Sensor on it, the sleep current is **lower than 10&nbsp;¬µA**. When a LoRa module is transmitting, the current may reach **130&nbsp;mA**.

| **Conditions**                                   | **Current** | **Unit** |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | -------- |
| Leakage current, without any module on RAK19026  | 2           | ¬µA       |
| Idle current, with MCU and sensors in sleep mode | 10          | ¬µA       |
| Working current, with LoRa module transmitting   | 130         | mA       |


##### Battery Connector

The RAK19026 WisMesh Base can be powered by a rechargeable battery, connected to the **P2 connector**. The nominal operating voltage of the battery should be within the range shown in the following table. The matching connector for the battery wires is an <a href="https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=199" target="_blank">JST PHR-2 2&nbsp;mm pitch female</a>.

| **Minimum** | **Typical** | **Maximum** | **Unit** |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 3.3         | 3.7         | 4.3         | V        |

<br>

The Type-C USB connector is used as a charging port. The voltage and current fed to the battery through the port should not exceed its charging limits, as shown in the table below.

| **Parameter**    | **Value**        |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Charging voltage | 4.5 ‚Äì 5.5&nbsp;V |
| Charging current | 350&nbsp;mA      |

<br>

A suitable Li-Ion battery should have the following parameters as shown in the table below:

| **Parameter**     | **Value**            |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Standard voltage  | 3.7&nbsp;V           |
| Charging voltage  | 4.2&nbsp;V           |
| Capacity          | As required          |
| Discharge current | At least 500&nbsp;mA |


:::tip üìù NOTE
Do not use a non-rechargeable battery.

##### Solar Panel Connector

A 5&nbsp;V solar panel can be connected to the board via the **P1 connector**. The solar panel can also be used to charge the Li-Ion battery. The matching connector for the solar panel wires is an <a href="https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=287" target="_blank">JST ZHR-2 1.5&nbsp;mm pitch female</a>.
