### Connecting to The Things Stack (TTN V3)

This section will show how to connect the RAK811 Breakout Board to The Things Stack (TTN V3) platform.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/4.ttn-context.png"
  width="95%"
  caption="The Things Stack diagram"
/>

As shown in **Figure 4**, The Things Stack is an open source LoRaWAN Network Server suitable for global, geo-distributed public and private deployments as well as for small, local networks. The architecture follows the LoRaWAN Network Reference Model for standards compliancy and interoperability. This project is actively maintained by [The Things Industries](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/).

LoRaWAN is a protocol for low-power wide-area networks. It allows for large scale Internet of Things deployments where low-powered devices efficiently communicate with Internet-connected applications over long range wireless connections.

The RAK811 Board can be part of this ecosystem as a device, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple it is to send data to The Things Stack using the LoRaWAN protocol. To achieve this, the RAK811 Board must be located inside the coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway connected to The Things Stack server.


#### Registration to TTN and Creating LoRaWAN Applications

The first step is to go to [The Things Network platform](https://console.cloud.thethings.network/) and select a cluster, as shown in **Figure 5**. The Things Industries adds more clusters from time to time so select the one closes to your location. In this guide, Europe 1 is selected.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/t_image_1.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Selecting Cluster in TTN V3"
/>

You can use the same login credentials on the TTN V2 if you have one. If you have no account yet, you need to create one.

To register as a new user to TTN, click on **Login with The Things ID** then select **register** on the next page, as shown in **Figures 6** and **7**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/t_image_2.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Login using TTN account"
/>

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/t_image_3.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Registration of new account"
/>

You should now be on the step of creating your TTN account. Fill all the necessary details and activate your account.

After creating an account, you should log in on the platform using your username/email and password then click **Submit** as shown in Figure 8.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/t_image_4.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Logging in to TTN platform"
/>

You need to click **Authorize** to proceed.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/t_image_5.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Authorization to TTN"
/>

Now that you are logged in to the platform, the next step is to create an application. Click **Create an application**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/t_image_6.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Creating TTN application for your LoRaWAN devices"
/>

To have an application registered, you need to input first the specific details and necessary information about your application then click **Create application**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/t_image_7.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Details of the TTN application"
/>

If you have no error on the previous step, you should now be on the application console page. The next step is to add end-devices to your The Things Stack application. LoRaWAN specification enforce that each end device has to be personalized and activated. There are two options in registering devices depending on the activation mode selected. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or Activation-By-Personalization (ABP).

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Once you have the application in The Things Stack (TTN V3), you need to ensure that you are in coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway that is registered to The Things Stack (TTN V3) as well. Without the coverage of that LoRaWAN gateway, you cannot activate any device that you will register in your application.

RAKwireless has [LoRaWAN gateways](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisgate) that you can connect to The Things Stack (TTN V3) if no LoRaWAN gateway coverage available in your location.

:::

#### The Things Stack OTAA Device Registration

You need to go to your application console to be able to register a device. To start adding an OTAA end device, you need to click **+ Add end device**, as shown in **Figure 12**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/t_image_8.png"
  width="100%"

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/t_image_10.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Device activation configuration"
/>

Then you need to put a unique **End device ID** and EUIs (**DevEUI** and **AppEUI**), as shown in Figure 15. Check if your module has a DevEUI on sticker or QR that you can scan then use this as the device unique DevEUI.

Optionally, you can add a more descriptive **End device name** and **End device description** about your device.

After putting all the details, you need to click **Network layer settings** to proceed to the next step.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

It is advisable to use a meaningful End device ID, End device name, and End device description that will match your device purpose. The End device ID `rak-device` is for illustration purposes only.

:::

  caption="OTAA AppKey generation and device registration"
/>

You should now be able to see the device on The Things Stack console after you fully registered your device, **as shown in Figure 18**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

The **AppEUI**, **DevEUI**, and **AppKey** are the parameters that you will need to activate your LoRaWAN end-device via OTAA. The **AppKey** is hidden by default for security reasons, but you can easily show it by clicking the show button. You can also copy the parameters quickly using the copy button.

The three OTAA parameters on The Things Stack device console are MSB by default.

These parameters are always accessible on the device console page, as shown in Figure 18.

### LoRa P2P Mode

This section shows how to use LoRa P2P mode. You will be using EU868 as the frequency, although it is applicable to other standard bands.

1. First, find two RAK811 Breakout Board which can work on EU868 frequency and make sure their firmware version isn‚Äôt less than V3.0.0.1.

2. Next, connect these two RAK811 Breakout Board with PC through UART, and open two serial port tool on PC.

3. Set the RAK811 to work in LoRa P2P mode. Open the RAK Serial Port Tool and send the following command:

```sh
at+set_config=lora:work_mode:1
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/lora-p2p-mode/lora-p2p.png"
  width="45%"
  caption="P2P Initialization"
/>

4. Then, configure LoRa P2P parameters for both of them.


```
at+set_config=lorap2p:XXX:Y:Z:A:B:C
```

For this example, the LoRa parameters are the following:

- Link frequency: **869525000&nbsp;Hz**
- Spreading factor: **7**
- Bandwidth: **125&nbsp;kHz**
- Coding Rate: **4/5**
- Preamble Length: **5**
- Power: **5&nbsp;dBm**

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Refer to the [Configuring Using AT Commands](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK811-Module/AT-Command-Manual/) section to learn more about the definition of the parameters used.

:::

Hence, it is translated into the following RAK811 AT command and sent to both units.

```
at+set_config=lorap2p:869525000:7:0:1:5:5
```

  width="45%"
  caption="Configuring P2P in both RAK811 Breakout Board Nodes"
/>

5. Set the transmission mode of the module. Unit 1 is configured as the sender, and Unit 2 is set to the receiver by AT command.

```
at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:2

at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:1
```

6. Try sending a message from Unit 1 to Unit 2.

```
at+send=lorap2p:1234567890
```

## Miscellaneous

### Upgrading the Firmware

:::tip üìù NOTE:

For RAK811 modules with firmware version V3.0.0.12 and below, you need to use the [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) to upgrade your firmware and upload the **.hex file** (not the .bin file) of the [latest RAK811 firmware](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/LoRa/RAK811/Firmware/). The lower versions of the firmware have a different bootloader code and will not work on the RAK DFU Tool.

:::

Execute the following procedure to upgrade the firmware in Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) mode through the UART1 interface.

1.	Download the latest application firmware of the RAK811 that can be found on the datasheet.
    - [RAK811 Breakout Board Datasheet](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK811-Breakout-Board/Datasheet/#firmware-os)

2. Download and open the RAK Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) tool.
    - [RAK Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/LoRa/Tools/RAK_Device_Firmware_Upgrade_tool/)

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/upgrading-the-firmware/2.device-firmware.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="RAK Upgrade Tool"
/>

3. Click ‚Äú**Choose File**‚Äù and choose the firmware you have downloaded for your desired frequency band.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/upgrading-the-firmware/3.select-firmware.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Choosing the Correct Upgrade file"
/>

4. Click ‚Äú**Start**‚Äù to upgrade. This may take a minute.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/upgrading-the-firmware/4.firmware-upgrading.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Firmware Upgrading in Process"
/>

5. You should see the same pop-window, as shown in **Figure 62**, if everything went well.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak811-breakout-board/quickstart/upgrading-the-firmware/5.upgrade-success.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Successfully Upgraded Firmware"
/>

6. Now, **CLOSE** the upgrade tool and **OPEN** the serial port too, again.

- It is recommended to use the RAK serial port tool since there are some ready AT commands in this tool that are very useful for you. You can get it from RAK website available for free at this **[RAK directory](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/RAK811/Tools/RAK_SERIAL_PORT_TOOL_V1.2.1.zip)**.

7. Choose the correct **COM port** and set the baud rate to **115200**. Then, open the serial port and enter the AT command shown below to restart. Another option is to press the **RST** button on the RAK811 Breakout Board.

```sh
at+set_config=device:restart
```

If you want to configure your RAK811 Breakout Board using the available **AT commands**, check the [AT Commands for RAK811 Breakout Board](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK811-Breakout-Board/AT-Command-Manual/).
