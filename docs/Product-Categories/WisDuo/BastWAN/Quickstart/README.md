/>

You can also flash the bootloader by using the [RAKDAP1 Flash and Debug Tool](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Accessories/RAKDAP1-Flash-and-Debug-Tool/Overview/). The guide on how to connect RAK3244 to RAKDAP1 can be found on [SWD Programming Interface section of RAK3244 datasheet](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/BastWAN/Datasheet/#interfaces).

After ensuring the correct wiring connection, you can now flash the bootloader using the `pyocd` command. If you do not have pyocd installed on your system, check the [pyocd installation guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Accessories/RAKDAP1-Flash-and-Debug-Tool/Quickstart/#pyocd-installation).

```
pyocd flash -t atsaml21j18a bootloader-bast-wan-v3.4.0.bin
```

Once the command is executed, the bootloader should be flashed successfully. You can now connect the RAK3244 BastWan to your PC.

### Setting up The Things Network (TTN)

In this section, The Things Network (TTN) and the procedure to set up the platform to connect with RAK3244 BastWAN are explained.

<rk-img

As shown in **Figure 2**, the RAK3244 BastWAN is one of the devices located on the left side. In the context of an IoT solution, the objective is to deploy devices to sense the relevant process variables and transmit the data to the backend servers located in the cloud. The data will be processed and integrated as part of a larger solution that could generate efficiency, traceability, predictability capacity among others.

The RAK3244 BastWAN can be part of this ecosystem, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple to send data to the TTN using the LoRaWAN protocol. To achieve this, the RAK3244 BastWAN must be located inside the coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The device name used for the setup is "RAK4260" since it is the core of RAK3244 BastWAN. You can designate any device name you want on your setup.

### LoRaWAN Library Installation

RAK3244 BastWAN board uses the Beelan-LoRaWAN library, which supports LoRaWAN Class A and Class C implementations operating in EU-868, AS-923, US-915, and AU-915 bands. You can recognize this library as the `<lorawan.h>` on the sample code.

In order for the sample code to work, the Beelan-LoRaWAN library must be installed. To do this, navigate to **Tools > Manage Libraries** on Arduino IDE. Then search for **Beelan LoraWAN** and install the latest version of the library. The window indicates if the library is installed, as shown in **Figure 15**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/bastwan/quickstart/library-installed.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Beelan LoRaWAN library installed"
/>

Visit the [Beelan-LoRaWAN official GitHub repository](https://github.com/BeelanMX/Beelan-LoRaWAN) for more information.

## First Test

For a quick test, a sample source code is provided for a LoRaWAN Class A node with OTAA support. Download the source code and open it with Arduino IDE.

- [Example source code for RAK3244 BastWAN](https://github.com/RAKWireless/Evaluation_Boards/tree/master/RAK4260/Arduino/send-class-A-OTAA)

The following sections will demonstrate how to modify LoRaWAN parameters to establish a connection with The Things Network (TTN).

### Modifying LoRaWAN Parameters

For the RAK3244 BastWAN to successfully connect to a LoRaWAN Platform, several parameters must be properly configured. Not doing so will result in connection failure.

The most volatile parameters on LoRaWAN configuration are the Device EUI, Application EUI, and Application Keys. These data must match with the ones on The Thing Network (TTN) platform. Copy the EUIs and Keys from the TTN platform and paste them on the sample source code. **Figure 17** shows the lines of codes that should be modified:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/bastwan/quickstart/dev_app_eui.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Device EUI, Application EUI, and Application Keys"
/>

### Compiling and Flashing the Firmware

Now that the LoRaWAN parameters are set, you can now run the sample program.

Click the **Verify** button on the upper left of Arduino IDE to compile the code. Before uploading the sample firmware, make sure that the RAK3244 BastWAN is connected and recognized by your PC. To verify this, there must be an assigned port on the **Tools** toolbar of Arduino IDE. It should not be grayed out.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/bastwan/quickstart/compilation.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Compilation of sample source code"
/>

If everything is well, you can now click the **Upload** button and the firmware should be flashed to your RAK3244 BastWAN.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/bastwan/quickstart/uploading.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Uploading of sample source code"
/>

The RAK3244 BastWAN will try to join the LoRaWAN network server, and if it is successful, it will send a string to verify its presence. You can find more details of the operation by examining the sample source code and opening the serial monitor.

Feel free to experiment with your own and explore the capabilities of RAK3244 BastWAN.
