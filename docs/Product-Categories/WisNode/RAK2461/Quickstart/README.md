# RAK2461 Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisite

Before going through each and every step in the installation guide of the WisNode Bridge IO Lite, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware Tools

1. <a href="https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak2461-wisnode-bridge-io-lite?utm_source=rak2461&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore" target="_blank">RAK2461 WisNode Bridge IO Lite</a>
2. USB configuration cable
3. Gateway in range, for Testing
4. A Windows/macOS/Linux Computer

#### Software Tools

IO.Box Desktop is a software application that will allow you to configure the devices from the RAK24XX series. You can download the application from here: 

- <a href="https://downloads.rakwireless.com/#WisIO/" target="_blank">Windows</a>
- <a href="https://downloads.rakwireless.com/#WisIO/" target="_blank">Linux</a>
- <a href="https://downloads.rakwireless.com/#WisIO/" target="_blank">Mac</a>

#### Package Inclusion

- One (1) RAK2461 WisNode Bridge IO Lite
- One (1) Mounting Kit
- One (1) Screw Kit
- One (1) LoRa Antenna
- One (1) Power Adapter
- One (1) USB Cable (Type C to Type A)
- One (1) 4-Pin Terminal Block 
- Two (2) 8-Pin Terminal Block

## Product Configuration

### Typical Network Application

RAK2461 WisNode Bridge IO Lite provides different Digital Inputs, Outputs (Relay), and RS485 communication. It can convert the data of the connected devices into LoRaWAN that can be sent to the cloud via a standard gateway. Cloud servers can also actively send data to RS485 terminals and control the DI/DO transmission to achieve two-way data transmission. Using RAK2461, what used to be a costly and time-consuming cable line network deployment can be transformed into a rapid and cost-efficient wireless network deployment.

An example would be using the <a href="https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak7268-8-channel-indoor-lorawan-gateway?m=3&h=wisgate-edge&variant=42316463210694" target="_blank">RAK7268V2 WisGate Edge Lite 2</a> LoRaWAN gateway coupled with the RAK WisDM cloud management platform, to realize an end-to-end industrial field data acquisition and control system. Using the built-in LoRa Server, which comes standard with any RAK LoRaWAN gateway, one could seamlessly achieve transmission of the end device data to any application server. Furthermore, the MQTT integration allows for high security and efficiency.

### Connect the RAK2461 to the Sensor

#### Power Interface Configuration

The RAK2461 device can be powered either by:

- 9-24&nbsp;V<sub>DC</sub> input
- USB type-C

The USB type-C port of the device can be used for configuration. Powering the device from the type-C port will not provide power to the sensor but only to the device itself. To power the device and sensor, you should use the 9-24&nbsp;V<sub>DC</sub> input of the RAK2461.

The RS485 serial interface supports up to 32 RS485 devices. The Vout pin can supply the external power to the RS485 sensors connected to RAK2561.

#### Data Interface Connection

For this example, an RS-FSXCS-N01-3 Ultrasonic Weather Station is used. Here are the basic communication parameters of the sensor:

| Parameter      | Definition                                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Format         | 8-bit binary                                 |
| Data bit       | 8-bit                                        |
| Parity         | No                                           |
| Stop bit       | 1                                            |
| Error checking | CRC                                          |
| Baud rate      | Supports: 2400, 4800, 9600 (default is 4800) |

### RAK2461 Configuration

#### Connect the rak2461 to Your Network

1. Download and open the IO.Box application.
2. Connect the rak2461 to a computer using the USB type-C cable. Note that this will work for the LoRaWAN configuration, but when configuring the sensor you would need to connect the 9-24&nbsp;V<sub>DC</sub> power supply in order to provide power to the sensor itself. Make sure that the USB type-C cable that you are using supports data transfer and no other serial software is connected to the COM port that RAK2461 uses.
3. Click **Connect Device** in the IO.Box console.

<rk-img
src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak2461-n/quickstart/iobox-get-started.png"
width="80%"
caption="IOBox get started"
/>

If an error occurs that shows no device detected, here are some possible causes for that and how to fix it:

- Double-check the quality of the USB cable and if the correct COM port is used.
- Check if other terminal software is active and still connected to the RAK2461.

<rk-img
src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak2461-n/quickstart/iobox-error.png"
width="80%"
caption="No device error"
/>

4. On the IO.Box dashboard screen, you can see information about the devices connected to the PC in the form of a list of connected devices with device models and EUIs. Choose the device that you wish to configure via the **Connect** button next to it.

<rk-img
src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak2461-n/quickstart/list-of-connected-device.png"
width="80%"
caption="List of connected devices"
/>

5. On the main menu to the left, choose **LoRaWAN** to configure the LoRaWAN settings as needed. Do not forget to click **Save** below the changes.

- **Device EUI** - This is the unique identifier provided by RAKwireless.
- **Region** - The LoRaWAN region/band.
- **Class** - The LoRaWAN class (A,B or C).
- **Join Mode** - Choose between OTAA and ABP according to LoRaWAN protocol.
- **Application EUI** - Enter the unique identifier assigned by the application server.
- **Application Key** - Enter the unique secure key assigned by the application server.
- **Confirm Mode** - Activate to receive confirmation messages from the network server for each uplink.
- **ADR** - Enable Adaptive Data Rate allowing the network server to control the data rate for your device.
- **DataRate** - Manually set the data transmission rate. Lower rates extend coverage but increase transmission time and power usage. Choose based on the distance and signal quality to the gateway.
- **TX Power Level** - Adjust the transmission power level. The lower the number the higher the power. 0 is the maximum allowed in the selected region and each incrementation of 1 to the number reduces the power by 2 dBm.
- **Data Report Interval** - Set up the global data report period of the device. Range: 60‚Äì86400 in seconds.
- **LoRaWAN Status** - Indicates the activity of the device in the LoRaWAN network.
- To check the previously configured Application EUI and Key, run the commands:

<rk-img
src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak2461-n/quickstart/lorawan-tab.png"
width="80%"
caption="LoRaWAN tab"
/>

6. Make sure you've added the RAK2461 WisNode Bridge IO Lite to the LoRaWAN Network Server of choice (Built-in LNS in this example).
7. After the device has successfully joined the LNS, you will see the LoRaWAN status toggle as activated. You might need to refresh the page.
