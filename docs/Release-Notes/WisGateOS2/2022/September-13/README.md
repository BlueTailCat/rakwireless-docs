| 2   | Support LBT (Country Setting) | LoRaWAN is a multi-channel protocol that uses the ISM band. If two or more end devices send signals simultaneously, a collision occurs. LBT (Listen Before Talk) means that before data transmission, the gateway will listen to its radio environment to detect whether the channel is idle. If the channel is in a busy state, wait for the channel to be idle before transmitting to avoid channel access conflict and realize channel spectrum sharing. <br> LBTs are usually administered by each country's regulatory body. In the Country settings plugin, you can set the country you are in and the frequency band you are using.  <br> Note: Base version should be WisGateOS2.1 or new version. | [WisGateOS 2 Extensions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Software-APIs-and-Libraries/WisGateOS-2-Extensions/Overview/) |
| 3   | WireGuard                     | WireGuard is a simple and fast general-purpose VPN proxy tool, and the gateway supports adding WireGuard extension components. It provides a connection mode to securely access the gateway remotely through the public network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [WisGateOS 2 Extensions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Software-APIs-and-Libraries/WisGateOS-2-Extensions/Overview/) |
| 4   | Solar Battery                 | The solar battery extension is used to display the status of the solar battery used by the gateway, including information such as the performance of the solar battery, the battery health state, the cycle period, the battery power, the charging and discharging mode, etc. Responsive UI design allows you to know the status of solar batteries in real time on both PC and mobile phones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [WisGateOS 2 Extensions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Software-APIs-and-Libraries/WisGateOS-2-Extensions/Overview/) |
| 5   | Open/Close Port               | Users can add or delete packet traffic management rules on the gateway through the Open/Close port extension, allowing any (or specific) network segment host IP to communicate with the gateway through the specified port. Customize the packet traffic management rules to manage flexibly the packet traffic flowing through the gateway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [WisGateOS 2 Extensions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Software-APIs-and-Libraries/WisGateOS-2-Extensions/Overview/) |
