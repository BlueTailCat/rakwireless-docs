## Product Description

RAK4600 Evaluation Board is designed to give you a quick start to explore the LoRa/LPWAN world. The board measures 30 x 60&nbsp;mm and supports USB power supply, 3.7&nbsp;V LiPo battery, and 5&nbsp;V solar charging.

The board itself has the RAK4600 as its core which is a module that utilizes Nordic nRF52832 MCU and an SX1276 LoRa chip. The high level of integration allows for outstanding performance: Lora TX Power of up to 20&nbsp;dBm.

The board complies with LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification, and it also supports LoRa P2P Point-to-Point communication. The low power, long-range LoRa communication capabilities of the board make it suitable for a variety of applications in the IoT field such as home automation, sensor networks, building automation, and personal area networks applications, such as health/fitness sensors and monitors.
