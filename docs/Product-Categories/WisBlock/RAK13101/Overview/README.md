## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK13101**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** with IO slot to plug the module in and a dedicated battery because the USB current from your PC won't be enough to power the Quectel MC20CE during cellular transmissions. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to use the cellular module and a sim card that works in your location.
