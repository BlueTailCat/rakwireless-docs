# RAK4260 Evaluation Board Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

RAK4260 Evaluation Board is designed to give you a quick start to explore the LoRa/LPWAN world. The board measures 30 x 60&nbsp;mm and supports USB power supply, 3.7&nbsp;V LiPo battery and 5&nbsp;V solar charging.

The board itself has the RAK4260 as its core, which is a module that utilizes ATSAMR34J18B SiP. The high level of integration allows for outstanding performance: Lora TX Power of up to 20&nbsp;dBm.

The board complies with LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification, and it also supports LoRa P2P Point-to-Point communication. The low-power, long-range LoRa communication capabilities of the board make it suitable for a variety of applications in the IoT field such as home automation, sensor networks, building automation, and personal area networks applications such as health/fitness sensors and monitors.

##### SWD Programming Interface

When programming via a DAPLink tool, it is required to have all of the following four (4) pins connected to your DAPLink tool:

1. **3V3**
2. **SWDIO**
3. **SWCLK**
4. **GND**

::: tip üìù NOTE
For the aforementioned reason, it is best you leave these exposed for programming purposes and not to remap them as GPIOs.

### Flash the Firmware Using DAPLink and RAKDAP1

Refer to section [Flash the Firmware Using DAPLink and RAKDAP1](../Low-Level-Development/#flash-the-firmware-using-daplink-and-rakdap1).

##### RF Interface

The RF pin of the RAK4260 Evaluation Board is connected to an external LoRa Antenna through a standard iPEX antenna connector.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Before powering the RAK4260 Evaluation Board, you should install the LoRa antenna first. Not doing so might damage the board.
:::

##### USB Interface

The Micro-B USB connector is compliant with the USB2.0 specification. The pin definition of the USB interface is shown below:

| **Pin Number** | **Pin Name | **Description**             |
| -------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| 1              | USB_VBUS   | (+5&nbsp;V) USB Bus Voltage |
| 2              | USB_DM     | USB Bus D+ positive pin     |
| 3              | USB_DP     | USB Bus D- negative pin     |
| 4              | NC         | Not connected               |
| 5              | GND        | Ground                      |

The USB data bus is connected to a **USB-SERIAL CH-340** chip. The **CH-340** is basically a USB bus convert chip that allows the USB to be converted to serial interface and serial interface pins converted to USB.


#### Pin Definition

The following tables below shows the pin definitions of the RAK4260 Evaluation Board:

##### J10, J11, J12 2.54&nbsp;mm header

On the RAK4260 Evaluation Board, there are three 2.54&nbsp;mm pitch headers used for IO extension. Some data bus and signal from the MCU module are also connected to these headers, such as I2C, UART, ADC, etc.

##### LEDs

Three LEDs are used to indicate the operating status. Below are the functions of the LEDs:

- üî¥ **Red LED** - connected to the charger chip to indicate the charger status. When the battery is charging, this red LED is on. When the battery is full, this LED is weak light or off.
- üü¢ **Green LED** - connected to the MCU module pin PA27.
- üîµ **Blue LED** - connected to the MCU module pin PA06.

##### RESET Button

The reset push button is connected to the reset pin of the RAK4260. When pushed, it resets the MCU.

##### TXCO Power Pin Definition

The TXCO (Temperature compensated crystal oscillator) power pin is PB03.
