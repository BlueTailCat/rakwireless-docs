# RAK10700 WisBlock GNSS Tracker for LoRaWAN Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisites

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step in the installation guide of the GNSS Tracker, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:


#### Hardware Tools

1. [**GNSS Tracker**](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/lpwan-tracker-solution-kit?utm_source=RAK10700&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
2. Micro USB Cable
3. LoRaWAN gateway in range
4. Windows PC

#### Software Tools

Serial Terminal Application, for example [Termite Serial Terminal](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm).

### What's Included in the Package

1. WisBlock GNSS Tracker
2. IP65 enclosure (optional with solar panel)
3. Micro USB cable

::: tip üìù NOTE

The GNSS module will take some time to get a location fix. The time depends on many factors but can take up to 45 seconds. The period of how often a location should be sent should be calculated taking into account:

1) Time to get a location fix (up to 45 seconds);
2) Local LoRaWAN regulations regarding duty cycles.

:::

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

If the sending period is set too small (location cannot be fixed by the GNSS module), the device will not be able to send valid location data to the LoRaWAN server.

:::

### Battery Connection

RAK10700 can be powered via the USB cable or Li-Ion/LiPo battery via the dedicated connectors, as shown in **Figure 1**. The matching connector for the battery wires is an [JST PHR-2 2&nbsp;mm pitch female](https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=199).


<rk-img

  width="40%"
  caption="Battery Connection"
/>

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

The RAK10700 does come without a battery. You need to add a rechargeable battery and connect it to the battery connector inside the enclosure.

- Battery can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause fire.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the RAK5005-O board used in the RAK10700. Not all batteries have the same wiring.

### Connecting to the Helium Network

Helium has quickly become the most widespread LPWAN communal network with more than 400,000 hotspots deployed globally at the beginning of 2021. All the RAKwireless node products are compatible with it, and the process of adding a device to the network is intuitive and straightforward.

This section will focus on giving a brief guide on how to connect the GNSS Tracker to the network console, assuming that there is a Helium Hotspot within range.

1. Login or create your account on the [Helium console page](https://console.helium.com/).


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/connecting-to-helium-network/1.helium-console.png"
  width="85%"
  caption="Helium console"
/>

2. Once registered and logged in, you will end up at the home page where you can see your function tree on the left and your DC balance at the top, as well as several useful links.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/connecting-to-helium-network/2.home.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Helium console home screen"
/>

3. Go to the **Devices** section in the function tree. If this is your first time doing this, there will be no devices registered. Click the **+ Add Device** button to get started.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/connecting-to-helium-network/3.device-section.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Devices section"
/>

4. A window will pop up with a set of fields containing the device parameters required for its registration.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/connecting-to-helium-network/4.add-device.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="Adding a new device"
/>

5. Fill in a name of your choosing. The **Dev EUI**, **App EUI**, and **App Key** will have random values generated for you by default. Press the eye icon to reveal the values. You can manually replace them with values of your own. For this tutorial, use the default values. Press the **Submit** button, and you are done.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/connecting-to-helium-network/5.registered-device.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Helium devices"
/>

6. To see the decoded values in the Helium Console, create a **Flow** that decodes the data.

- First, go to **Functions** in the Helium Console and create a new function. For the name, you can choose anything, the function type needs to be **Decoder**. For the format, choose **Cayenne LPP**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/connecting-to-helium-network/5a-add-function.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Helium decoder"
/>

- Next, go to **Flows** in the Helium Console and create a new flow. Connect your device to the flow that you just created.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/connecting-to-helium-network/5b-add-flow.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Helium flow"
/>

7. Now, your GNSS Tracker is registered and is awaiting activation. For this to happen, you need to import the Dev EUI, App EUI, and App Key in the GNSS Tracker using the Serial Port Tool.

8. Open the tool, select the desired port (default baud rate) and open it. Then start importing your settings.

9. Configure your LoRa band and activation mode. This tutorial will be using the AS923-3 band and OTAA (the only option available for now with Helium) with device class A (the default one and does not need configuring).

:::tip üìù NOTE:

The different regions are selected by number:
- 0: AS923
- 1: AU915
- 2: CN470
- 3: CN779
- 4: EU433
- 5: EU868
- 6: KR920
- 7: IN865
- 8: US915
- 9: AS923-2
- 10: AS923-3
- 11: AS923-4
- 12: RU864

:::

- Regional band and activation mode setting


```
AT+NJM=1
```

```
AT+BAND=10
```

- Enter the Dev UI

Use the command below by replacing the XXXX with your Device EUI from the Helium console:


```
AT+DEVEUI=XXXX
```

- Enter the App EUI

Update the APPEUI value of your LPWAN tracker by replacing the `XXXX` with the APPEUI value you get from the Helium Console:

```
AT+APPEUI=XXXX
```

- Enter the App Key

You also need to update the APPKEY by getting the 16-byte APPKEY from the Helium Console:

```
AT+APPKEY=XXXX
```

- Join Network

Finish executing the join command for the node to initiate the join procedure.

```
AT+JOIN=1:0:8:30
```

Once the procedure is initiated and successfully completed, you will have a notification in the serial console.

2. Using the Serial Port Tool, set the join mode, device class, and your LoRaWAN region to your correct frequency band, with the following set of AT commands:


- For the join mode (OTAA):

```
AT+NJM=1
```

- For the class (Class A):

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

- For the region:

```
AT+BAND=5
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Remember to replace the **frequency band** with the one for your LoRaWAN region. Check first your [frequency plan](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/frequencies-by-country.html).

### Connecting with ChirpStack

In this section, a practical exercise will be performed to show how to connect the GNSS Tracker to the ChirpStack platform.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/connecting-to-chirpstack/34.chirpstack-platform.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="GNSS Tracker in the context of the ChirpStack platform"
/>

The ChirpStack, previously known as the LoRaServer project, provides open-source components for building LoRaWAN networks. Like the case of TTN, the GNSS Tracker is located in the periphery and transmits the data to the backend servers through a LoRa gateway. Learn more about [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/).

:::tip üìù NOTE:

In this guide, it is assumed that you are using a RAK LoRa gateway, such as RAK7249. The gateway must be configured and registered previously to a Chirpstack deployment. For further information, check the Chirpstack documents for more details.

:::

In this section, you need the following requirements:

  1. A ChirpStack deployment
  2. Access to a LoRaWAN gateway registered at the ChirpStack server
  3. Chirpstack already setup with a Network Server and Service Profile
  3. Serial Port Tool
  4. GNSS Tracker

Before you start, you must choose which mode you are going to use, whether in OTAA or ABP mode, to register the device to the network server.

<b>Sign up and Log in</b>

Sign in to Chirpstack with your username and password.

#### Create a New Application

1. Go to the Application section, as shown in **Figure 34**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/connecting-to-chirpstack/35.application-section.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Section of ChirpStack LoRaServer"
/>

2. By default, you should create a new Application, although you can reuse the existing ones. For this setup, create a new Application by clicking on the ‚Äú**CREATE**‚Äù button, and filling the required parameters, as shown in **Figure 35** and **Figure 36**.

<rk-img

#### LoRaWAN Join Mode

In LoRaWAN, there are two ways a node can connect itself to the LoRaWAN network. This is referred to as **Join Mode**. LoRaWAN allows the OTAA mode and the ABP mode. In this section, the configuration process of these two modes, both on the platform side and the node side will be explained.

##### OTAA Mode

###### Configure the OTAA Mode on the Platform

You have created the device before as an OTAA device, and it can be used to connect the GNSS Tracker to Chirpstack using OTAA join mode.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Standard OTAA mode requires the **Device EUI**, **Application Key**, and the **Application EUI**. But in ChirpStack‚Äôs implementation, only the Device EUI and the Application Key are mandatory. The Application EUI is not required and is not recorded in the Application tab. Nevertheless, the Application EUI is a mandatory parameter in the LPWAN Tracker‚Äôs firmware. To resolve this mismatch, you can reuse the Device EUI as the Application EUI during the configuration on the side of the node.

:::


###### Configure the OTAA Mode on the GNSS Tracker

The GNSS Tracker supports a series of AT commands to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module.

To set up the GNSS Tracker to join ChirpStack using OTAA, start by connecting the GNSS Tracker to the Computer (see **Figure 2**). Open the RAK Serial Port Tool and wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending either of these two AT commands:


```
AT+STATUS=?
```

```
AT+VER=?
```

As an example, the following are the list of the parameters you need to configure in GNSS Tracker:

- LoRa join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRa class: **Class A**
- LoRa region: **AS923-3**
- Device EUI: **000d75e6564dc103**
- Application EUI: **Not used by Chirpstack**
- Application Key: **56D622507C0F5017E4E87F7EDE7839D5**

1. Set the LoRa join mode to OTAA.

```
AT+NJM=1
```

2. Set the LoRa class to Class A.

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

3. Set the frequency/region to AS923-3.

* Refer to the [GNSS Tracker Datasheet](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK10700/Datasheet/#rf-characteristics) for the list of supported frequencies.


```
AT+BAND=10
```

4. Set the Device EUI (if different to default GNSS Tracker DevEUI).

```
AT+DEVEUI=000d75e6564dc103
```

5. Set the Application Key (if different to default GNSS Tracker AppKey).

```
AT+APPKEY=56D622507C0F5017E4E87F7EDE7839D5
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/chirpstack-otaa-mode/47.settings-mode.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="Setting LoRa Application Key Parameter"
/>


:::tip üìù NOTE:
After configuring all the parameters, you need to reset the GNSS Tracker to save the parameters.
:::

7. After resetting, start to join.

```
AT+JOIN=1:0:8:30
```

After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request is successfully received by a LoRa gateway, then you should see the messages shown in **Figure 53**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/chirpstack-otaa-mode/53.otaa-join-chirpstack.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA Join the Network via Serial Port Tool"
/>

8. You can then see the **JoinRequest** and **JoinAccept** on the ChirpStack page.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/chirpstack-otaa-mode/54.chirpstack-console.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Checking LoRaWAN Joint Request in Chirpstack OTAA Console"
/>

9. On the ChirpStack platform, you should also see the messages in the LORAWAN FRAMES tab, as shown in **Figure 54**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

By convention, messages sent from nodes to gateways are considered as **Uplinks**, while messages sent by gateways to nodes are considered as **Downlinks**.
:::

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/chirpstack-otaa-mode/55.message-received.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack Data Received Preview"
/>

As the payload decoder is set as Cayenne LPP in the device profile, the data is decoded and you can see the values when you open the received frame in the Chirpstack Device Data tab:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/chirpstack-otaa-mode/56.message-decoded.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack Data Received Decoded Preview"
/>

##### ABP Mode

###### Configure the ABP Mode on the Platform

During the registration of a new device for OTAA join mode, you select **LPWAN-Tracker-OTAA**. To switch the device to ABP join mode, you need to change the Device Profile from **`LPWAN-Tracker-OTAA`** to **`LPWAN-Tracker-ABP`**, as shown in **Figure 57**, in the device **CONFIGURATION** tab

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Check **Disable counting frame verification**. During the test, when the module is restarted, the frame counting number will be also be restarted from zero. This would cause a synchronization problem with the ChirpStack server treating it as a replay attack. For the testing purpose, it is safe to disable this feature, but remember to activate it in a production environment.

  width="100%"
  caption="ChirpStack Console, Configuring a Device"
/>

Next, get the Device Address, Application Session Key, and Network Session Key from the device using the Serial Port Tool.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/chirpstack-abp-mode/55a-get-device.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="ChirpStack Console, Configuring a Device"
/>

In Chirpstack, after selecting the ABP mode, the following parameters appear in the Activation tab:

* Device address
* Network Session Key
* Application Session Key

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/chirpstack-abp-mode/56.abp-activation-parameters.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack ABP Activation Parameters Needed"
/>

* Set the parameters with the values received from the device.


###### Configure the ABP Mode on the GNSS Tracker

In the following steps, you will configure the GNSS Tracker to work in the ABP mode. To set up the GNSS Tracker to join ChirpStack using ABP start by connecting the GNSS Tracker to the Computer (see **Figure 2**). Open the Serial Port Tool and wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending either of these two AT commands:

```
AT+STATUS=?
```

```
AT+VER=?
```

As an example, the following are the list of the parameters you need to configure in GNSS Tracker:

- LoRa join mode: **ABP**
- LoRa class: **Class A**
- LoRa region: **AS923-3**
- Device address: **00781FB9**
- Network Session Key: **C280CB8D1DF688BC18601A97025C5880**
- Application Session Key: **4D42EC5CAF97F03D833CDAF5003F69E1**

1. Set LoRa join mode to ABP.

```
AT+NJM=0
```

2. Set LoRa class to Class A.

```
AT+CLASS=A
```

3. Set the frequency/region to AS923-3.

* Refer to the [GNSS Tracker Datasheet](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK10700/Datasheet/#rf-characteristics) for the list of supported frequencies.

```
AT+BAND=10
```

4. Set the Device Address (if different to default GNSS Tracker Device Address).

```
AT+DEVADDR=00781FB9
```

5. Set the Network Session Key (if different to default GNSS Tracker Network Session Key).

```
AT+NWKSKEY=C280CB8D1DF688BC18601A97025C5880
```

6. Set the Application Session Key (if different to default GNSS Tracker Application Session Key).

```
AT+APPSKEY=4D42EC5CAF97F03D833CDAF5003F69E1
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/chirpstack-abp-mode/62.abp-session.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="Setting LoRa Network Session Parameter"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:

After configuring all the parameters, you need to reset the GNSS Tracker to save the parameters.

:::

7. After resetting GNSS Tracker, join in ABP mode.

```
AT+JOIN=1:0:8:30
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

By using the ABP mode in the LoRaWAN protocol, it doesn‚Äôt require to join a network before sending the LoRaWAN package. But to keep the consistency of internal states of the firmware of the GNSS Tracker, it is still required to send the `AT+JOIN=1:0:8:30` command in the ABP mode. This time, the firmware should reply almost immediately with an ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.

:::

8. Once the GNSS Tracker joined into a LoRaWAN network, it will start to send periodically the data collected from the GPS and other sensors. Then go to the ChirpStack platform to confirm that the messages are properly received, as shown in **Figure 61**.

/>

9. As the payload decoder is set as Cayenne LPP in the device profile, the data is decoded and you can see the values when you open the received frame in the Chirpstack Device Data tab:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/chirpstack-abp-mode/56.message-decoded.png"

### Using LoRa P2P

LoRa P2P is a transmitting packet using the LoRa technology. Different from LoRaWAN, there is no transmission protocol available. Devices do not need to be registered on a server. LoRa P2P is not encrypting the packets during transmission. LoRa P2P packets cannot be received by LoRaWAN gateways.

To use LoRa P2P, you need at least two (2) devices. One device (the GNSS Tracker) is the sending device, and the other is the receiving device. To be able to transmit packets between the two devices, both devices need to be set up to use the same frequency, spreading factor (SF), bandwidth (BW), coding rate (CR), and preamble length (PL).
In this example we setup both devices to

| Parameter | Value             |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| Frequency | 916100000&nbsp;Hz |
| SF        | 7                 |
| BW        | 125&nbsp;kHz      |
| CR        | 4/5               |
| PL        | 8                 |

1. Set up P2P parameters, as shown in the table above.

```
AT+P2P=916100000:7:125:0:8:22
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/lora-p2p/1-settings.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="LoRa P2P Setup"
/>

2. If the receiver is set up with the same parameters, it will receive the packets from the GNSS Tracker.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak10700/quickstart/lora-p2p/2-received.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="LoRa P2P Data Received"
/>

3. The data is decoded in Cayenne LPP format and will require a decoder in your receiver module to get the values.

The next paragraph is explaining the payload format. If your receiver is using firmware based on Arduino, you can use a Cayenne LPP Decoder library like the [CayenneLPPdec](https://github.com/gmag11/CayenneLPPdec) to decode the payload.

### Decoding the Payload

#### Cayenne LPP Data Format

The Cayenne Low Power Payload (LPP) provides a convenient and easy way to send data over LPWAN networks such as LoRaWAN. The Cayenne LPP is compliant with the payload size restriction, which can be lowered down to 11 bytes, and allows the device to send multiple sensor data at a time or split into several frames.

The Data Channel uniquely identifies each sensor or actuator within a device. The acceptable range is from 0 to 64. The device developer is responsible to assign a unique channel for each of the device's sensor and actuator and conform to it across the device life cycle.

Data Types are based on the IPSO Alliance Smart Objects Guidelines, which identify each data type with an "Object ID". However, as shown below, a conversion is made to fit the Object ID into a single byte.

```
LPP_DATA_TYPE = IPSO_OBJECT_ID - 3200
```

Each data type can use 1 or more bytes to send the data according to the following table:

| Type               | IPSO | LPP | Hex | Data Size | Data Resolution per bit                                                                         |

#### Data Format Used

The packet data is based on the Cayenne LPP packet format, which makes it very easy to decode because most LoRaWAN servers and Integrations support this format already. The data format is like this:

```cpp
uint8_t data_flag1 = 0x01;  // 1 Cayenne LPP channel
uint8_t data_flag2 = 0x88;  // 2 Cayenne LPP location
uint8_t lat_1 = 0;      // 3
uint8_t lat_2 = 0;      // 4
uint8_t lat_3 = 0;      // 5
uint8_t long_1 = 0;     // 6
uint8_t long_2 = 0;     // 7
uint8_t long_3 = 0;     // 8
uint8_t alt_1 = 0;      // 9
uint8_t alt_2 = 0;      // 10
uint8_t alt_3 = 0;      // 11
uint8_t data_flag3 = 0x02;  // 12 Cayenne LPP channel
uint8_t data_flag4 = 0x02;  // 13 Cayenne LPP analog value
uint8_t batt_1 = 0;     // 14
uint8_t batt_2 = 0;     // 15
uint8_t data_flag5 = 0x03;  // 16 Cayenne LPP channel
uint8_t data_flag6 = 0x68;  // 17 Cayenne LPP humidity
uint8_t humid_1 = 0;    // 18
uint8_t data_flag7 = 0x04;  // 19 Cayenne LPP channel
uint8_t data_flag8 = 0x67;  // 20 Cayenne LPP temperature
uint8_t temp_1 = 0;     // 21
uint8_t temp_2 = 0;     // 22
uint8_t data_flag9 = 0x05;  // 23 Cayenne LPP channel
uint8_t data_flag10 = 0x73; // 24 Cayenne LPP barometric pressure
uint8_t press_1 = 0;    // 25
uint8_t press_2 = 0;    // 26
uint8_t data_flag11 = 0x06; // 27 Cayenne LPP channel
uint8_t data_flag12 = 0x02; // 28 Cayenne LPP analog value
uint8_t gas_1 = 0;      // 29
uint8_t gas_2 = 0;      // 30
```

This application uses the RAK1904 acceleration sensor only for the detection of movement to trigger the sending of a location packet, so the data packet does not include the accelerometer part.

### Miscellaneous

#### Upgrading the Firmware / Custom Firmware


##### Upgrading the Firmware

Before you start working with the GNSS Tracker, it is recommended to keep the GNSS Tracker updated to the latest version of the firmware. Download the latest [GNSS Tracker firmware](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK10700/Datasheet/#software).


##### Custom Firmware

The firmware of the RAK10700 WisBlock GNSS Tracker for LoRaWAN is open source. You can find the sources in our [Github Repo](https://github.com/RAKWireless/LPWAN-Tracker-Solution). You can find their projects for both Arduino IDE and PlatformIO. The sources in the two projects are identical.

You can extend the functionality of the GNSS Tracker by using these sources. You can as well write your own GNSS Tracker application based on these sources.

### Appendix

#### LoRa P2P Receiver App for GNSS Tracker

RAK4631 LoRa P2P receiver for GNSS Tracker Solution receives Cayenne LPP encoded packets over LoRa P2P, decodes them, and displays them in the serial log. It is based on the WisBlock API and sets up LoRa P2P parameters over AT command interface.

As it is based on the [WisBlock API](https://github.com/beegee-tokyo/WisBlock-API), the LoRa P2P parameters are not hardcoded in the source code. Instead, they are set with a single AT command.

##### Set Device Into LoRa P2P Mode
