- To add the RAKwireless Core boards on your Arduino board, install the RAKwireless Arduino BSP. Follow the steps in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index).

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

You can integrate the RAK5860 module on your WisBlock project to extend its functionality and have Cellular, LPWAN, LTE-M, and NB-IoT capability with GPS. This is ideal for IoT and tracking applications where there is a cellular LPWAN network in the area. For more information about RAK5860, refer to its [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

RAK5860 module can be mounted to the IO slot of the WisBlock Base and communicates with the WisBlock Core via UART. The module is activated via `WB_IO1` pin of the WisBlock Core. Two antennas must also be connected to the module, one for the GNSS antenna port and one for the Cellular antenna port. An external battery (Li-Ion/LiPo 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V) is also required to power up the module properly.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board, to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the WisBlock Base board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 3**, the location for the module slots is properly marked by silkscreen. Follow the procedure defined in the [WisBlock Base assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with one or more pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws, depending on the module.

::: tip üìù NOTE
If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock IO Pin Mapping Tool](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/) for possible conflicts. RAK5860 uses UART communication lines, and it can cause possible conflict, especially on some modules that also use UART.
:::

### Software Configuration and Example

The RAK5860 WisBlock GSM/GPRS Module uses UART serial communication lines. In this example code, you will be able to send AT commands to the RAK5860 module. This will ensure that your RAK5860 is functional and ready for your IoT project.

#### Initial Test of the RAK5860 WisBlock Module

If you have already installed the [RAKWireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKWireless-Arduino-BSP-Index), the WisBlock Core and example code should be available in the Arduino IDE.

1. First, you need to select the WisBlock Core you have, as shown in **Figure 7** to **Figure 9**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5860/quickstart/rak4631_board.png"
  width="100%"

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5860/quickstart/rak11300_board.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Selecting RAK11300 as WisBlock Core"
/>

2. You also need to select the right serial port to upload the code, as shown in **Figure 10**.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
If you are using RAK11200 as WisBlock Core, you need to configure the BOOT0 pin before uploading. You need to short it to the ground then press the reset button of the WisBlock Base before releasing the BOOT0 pin. If not done properly, uploading the source code to RAK11200 will fail. Check the full details on the [RAK11200 Quick Start Guide](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK11200/Quickstart/#uploading-to-wisblock).
:::

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5860/quickstart/select_port.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Selecting the correct Serial Port"
/>

3. Once you are ready with the Arduino IDE software and the WisBlock Core modules are already added, you can now check the Cellular examples available for the RAK5860 Cellular Wireless module. You can look at examples for TCP, MQTT, HTTP, and GPS on the [RAK5860 Examples Repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/common/communications/Cellular/RAK5860_BG77_Module).

4. The basic software example you can run is the [BG77_Unvarnished_Transmission](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/examples/common/communications/Cellular/RAK5860_BG77_Module/BG77_Unvarnished_Transmission). This is a UART passthrough to the BG77 from RAK4631. This code will power up the module correctly and after initialization, AT commands is passed and received to the BG77 module. In the example below, the module responded to `AT` and `ATI` commands.

##### Software Examples

This section provides different example codes that can be used with RAK5860.

- [GNSS Satellite](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK5860/Quickstart/#gnss-satellite-example)
- [HTTP Access](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK5860/Quickstart/#http-access-example)
- [TCP Client](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK5860/Quickstart/#tcp-client-example)
- [MQTT](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK5860/Quickstart/#mqtt-example)

The following examples will illustrate the different protocols where RAK5860 can be used to access and send data to cloud.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING
All the examples that use cellular connectivity should update the APN sections of the code. To illustrate, the code below configures the PDP context to `1` and APN to `data.mono` for Monogoto SIM.

You can purchase [Monogoto SIM in the RAKwireless store](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/iot-sim-card-for-wisnode-modules?_pos=2&_sid=0f017e546&_ss=r&variant=42658018787526).

```c
  command = "AT+QICSGP=1,1,\"data.mono\",\"\",\"\",1";
  BG77_write(command.c_str());
  BG77_read(2000);
```

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING
BG77 is based on a cost-optimized architecture in which WWAN (LTE Cat-M1, LTE Cat-NB2, and GSM) and GNSS Rx chains share certain hardware blocks. As a result, the modules do not support the concurrent operation of WWAN and GNSS.
:::

3. The process will turn on the GNSS and Acquire Positioning Information and Query Satellite System as shown in the example. It should be able to obtain the latitude and longitude during the 30&nbsp;s ~ 2&nbsp;mins on power up. Open the `Serial Terminal` of Arduino from the Tools tab to see the output data/coordinates.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
If there are no coordinates data shown, make sure that you are exposed to a clear sky. You can also double-check that the antenna connector is properly attached to the module.
