## Product Description

RAK811 Breakout Board is an easy to use, compact and low power long range LoRa technology with wireless transceiver capabilities. A combination of RAK811 chipset and RAK811 Breakout Board with Semtech SX1276 at its core which takes advantage of all LoRa features.

The RAK811 Breakout Board complies with the latest LoRaWAN Class A & C protocol specifications with fully supported LoRaWAN 1.0.2 stack in its firmware. It has a simple and straightforward setup and can quickly access LWPA IOT platforms. Additionally, it supports LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communications which helps customers in implementing their own private LoRa network.

The node can work in a number of modes, with different data rates and read data from the attached sensors with the help of its serial AT commands.

This board is a complete solution in developing your LoRaWAN protocol techniques. A few of its application includes: Automated Meters Reading, Home and Building Automation, Wireless Alarm and Security Systems, Industrial Monitoring and Control and Long Range Irrigation Systems
