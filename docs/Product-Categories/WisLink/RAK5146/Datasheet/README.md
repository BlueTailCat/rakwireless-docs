## Specifications

### Overview

The overview shows the top and back views of the RAK5146 board. It also presents the block diagram that discusses how the board works.

#### Board Overview

RAK5146 is a compact LPWAN Gateway Module, making it suitable for integration in systems where mass and size constraints are essential. It has been designed with the PCI Express Mini Card form factor in mind, so it can easily become a part of products that comply with the standard, where they allow cards with a thickness of at least 5.5&nbsp;mm.

The board has two UFL interfaces for the LoRa and GNSS antennas and a standard 52-pin connector (mPCIe).

#### Block Diagram

The RAK5146 concentrator is equipped with one SX1303 chip and two SX1250. The first chip is utilized for the RF signal and the core of the device, while the latter provides the related LoRa modem and processing functionalities. Additional signal conditioning circuitry is implemented for PCI Express Mini Card compliance, and one UFL connectors are available for external antenna integration.

### Hardware

The hardware is categorized into seven (7) parts. It discusses the interfacing, pinouts, and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the parameters and standard values of the board.

#### Interfaces

- **Power Supply** - The RAK5146 concentrator module must be supplied through the 3.3Vaux pins by a DC power supply. The voltage needs to be stable since the current drawn can vary significantly during operation based on the power consumption profile of the SX1303 chip (for more information, see the [SX1303 Datasheet](https://www.mouser.com/pdfDocs/Semtech_08072019_DS_SX1302_V10-1626824.pdf)).

- **SPI Interface** - SPI interface mainly provides for the Host_SCK, Host_MISO, Host_MOSI, Host_CSN pins of the system connector. The SPI interface gives access to the configuration register of SX1303 via a synchronous full-duplex protocol. Only the slave side is implemented.

- **USB Interface** - The USB interface mainly provides for the USB_D+, USB_D- pins of the system connector. The USB interface gives access to the configuration register of SX1303 via an MCU STM32L412KBU6. Only the slave side is implemented.

- **UART and I2C Interface** - RAK5146 integrates a ZOE-M8Q GPS module which has UART and I2C interface. The PINs on the golden finger provide a UART connection and an I2C connection, which allows direct access to the GPS module. The PPS signal is not only connected to SX1303 internally but also connected to the golden finger which can be used by the host board.

- **GPS_PPS** - RAK5146 includes the GPS_PPS input for received packets time-stamped and Fine timestamp.

- **RESET** - RAK5146 SPI card includes the RESET active-high input signal to reset the radio operations as specified by the SX1303 Specification. RAK5146 USB card’s RESET is controlled by MCU.

- **Antenna RF Interface** - The module has one RF interface over a standard UFL connector (Hirose U. FL-R-SMT) with a characteristic impedance of 50&nbsp;Ω. The RF port (J1) supports both Tx and Rx, providing the antenna interface.

#### Electrical Requirements

Stressing the device above one or more of the ratings listed in the Absolute Maximum Rating section may cause permanent damage. These are stress ratings only. Operating the module at these or any conditions other than those specified in the Operating Conditions sections of the specification should be avoided. Exposure to Absolute Maximum Rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

The operating condition range defines those limits within which the functionality of the device is guaranteed. Where application information is given, it is advisory only and does not form part of the specification.

##### Absolute Maximum Rating

The limiting values given below are following the Absolute Maximum Rating System (IEC 134).

:::tip 📝 NOTE
Although this module is designed to be as robust as possible, electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage this module. This module must be protected at all times from ESD when handling or transporting. Static charges may easily produce potentials of several kilovolts on the human body or equipment, which can discharge without detection. Industry-standard ESD handling precautions should be used at all times.
