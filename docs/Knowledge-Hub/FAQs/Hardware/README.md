# Hardware FAQs

<faq default-opened>
<template #question>
1. Can we develop our own Applications in RAK’s LoRaWAN modules?
</template>
<template #answer>

Yes, with the newly released **RAK RUI API**, it is now possible to connect specific sensors in your device. You will be able to customize your own firmware for your specific needs whether be a project or even as a hobby. Check out the [RUI API Reference](https://docs.rakwireless.com/RUI/rui-api-reference/) for more information about RAK RUI API. You can also check out this sample [Product Configuration](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisNode/RAK7204/Quickstart/#interfacing-with-the-rak7204-wisnode-sense-home).

2. What are the external interfaces in RAK5205 Wistrio LPWAN Tracker? What are the frequency bands that it supports and how many GPIOs are there?
</template>
<template #answer>

The RAK5205 LPWAN Tracker board is built on the Semtech SX1276 chip, with the STM32L1 MCU at its core. It supports **I2C, GPIOs, UART and ADC interfaces**. The board supports all LoRaWAN frequency channels (EU433, EU868, CN470 , US915, AS920, AS923, AU915, KR920, IN865) which is easy to configure while building the firmware from the source code. The RAK5205 has 7 GPIOs labeled as **PA8, PB3, PB5, SWD*TMS, SWD* CLK, LED1_PA12 and LED2_PB4**. Checkout the [RAK5205 WisTrio LPWAN Tracker Datasheet](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisTrio/RAK7205-5205/Datasheet/) for a full overview of the pinout diagram.

4. Will the RAK2245 Pi Hat work with the newly released Raspberry Pi 4?
</template>
<template #answer>

Yes. We have provided a pre-compiled firmware image that you can just easily use and flash it into your Raspberry Pi 4. You can refer to [RAK2245 Pi HAT Product Configuration](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisLink/RAK2245-Pi-HAT/Quickstart/#product-configuration).

Note:

- Use the official **USB-C Power supply** to have a stable power supply

5. What is the range that I can achieve with LoRa?
</template>
<template #answer>

Technically, one can achieve a range of **10-15&nbsp;km** but there are a lot of factors that one should consider like placement of gateway, type of antenna used, message payload, physical obstructions and many more. In RAKwireless, we have obtained with a range of **20&nbsp;km** through the use of the **RAK7249 Macro Outdoor Gateway**. Checkout the [RAKwireless LoRaWAN Coverage Drive Test Document](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/DIY-Gateway-RAK7249/Application-Notes/RAKwireless_LoRAWAN_Coverage_Drive_Test_Report.pdf) to learn more.

6. What is the meaning of the LED of the RAK612 LPWAN Button?
</template>
<template #answer>

Whenever the keys 1 - 4 is pressed, the corresponding basket light under each key lights up for 300&nbsp;ms. To enter Configuration Mode, long press Key 1 for at least 500&nbsp;ms. Press Key 1 again for at least 500&nbsp;ms to exit Configuration Mode.

| Mode                    | Red LED     | Green LED | Blue LED                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| Configuration Mode      | Steady ON   | OFF       | OFF                       |

7. What is the average power consumption of the RAK7249 Macro Outdoor Gateway with LTE working for both 8-channel and 16-channel LoRa?
</template>
<template #answer>

- Note: To attain such test condition, settings must be followed below:
  - **GPS and Wi-Fi**: Disabled
  - **4G and LoRa**: Enabled

* **At 8-Channels Working**

  - 12&nbsp;V DC Power Supply-Average Power: 12&nbsp;Volts x 0.32&nbsp;Amperes = **8.84&nbsp;Watts**
  - PoE 48&nbsp;V Power Supply-Average Power: 48&nbsp;Volts x 0.1&nbsp;Amperes = **4.8&nbsp;Watts**

* **At 16-Channels Working**
  - 12&nbsp;V DC Power Supply-Average Power: 12&nbsp;Volts x 0.46&nbsp;Amperes = **5.52&nbsp;Watts**
  - PoE 48&nbsp;V Power Supply-Average Power: 48&nbsp;Volts x 0.13&nbsp;Amperes = **6.24&nbsp;Watts**

10. Do all RAK gateways have GPS? Is it necessary at all?
</template>
<template #answer>

Yes, except for RAK7258 WisGate Edge Lite, which is an indoor gateway. All gateways have either a built-in GPS or have an input to use an external one. The GPS is mandatory for Class B, so that the beacons are all synchronized and to use multicasting as well.

11. How to factory reset the gateway? 
</template>
<template #answer>

- For WisGate Edge Gateways:
    
    - There are two ways to do a factory reset. One is from the Web UI: go to System > Backup/Flash Firmware > Perform reset. The second option is the reset button of the gateway itself by holding it for 10+ seconds.

- For WisGate Developer Gateways:
  
    - Reflash the firmware image on the SD card. On how to do so, refer to the documentation for the product in question.
