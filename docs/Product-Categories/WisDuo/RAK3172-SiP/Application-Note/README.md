## Power Supply Management

The RAK3172-SiP has embedded two different regulators: one LDO and one DC/DC (SMPS). The SMPS can be optionally switched on by software to improve power efficiency. As LDO and SMPS operate in parallel, the SMPS switch-on is transparent to the user and requires power efficiency. This section discusses both internal and external details of RAK3172-SiP related to the power supply.

### Power Supply Voltages

The devices require a VDD operating voltage supply between 1.8&nbsp;V and 3.6&nbsp;V. Several independent supplies (VDDSMPS, VFBSMPS, VDDA, VDDRF) can be provided for specific peripherals.

- **VDD = 1.8&nbsp;V to 3.6&nbsp;V**

VDD is the external power supply for the I/Os, the system analog blocks such as reset, power management, internal clocks, and low-power regulator. It is provided externally through VDD pins.

- **VDDSMPS = 1.8&nbsp;V to 3.6&nbsp;V**

VDDSMPS is the external power supply for the SMPS step-down converter. It is provided externally through the VDDSMPS supply pin and must be connected to the same supply as VDD.

- **VFBSMPS = 1.45&nbsp;V to 1.62&nbsp;V (1.55&nbsp;V typical)**

VFBSMPS is the external power supply for the main system regulator. It is provided externally through the VFBSMPS pin and is supplied through the SMPS step-down converter.

- **VDDA = 0&nbsp;V to 3.6&nbsp;V**

VDDA is the external analog power supply for A/D converters, D/A converters, voltage reference buffers, and comparators. The VDDA voltage level is independent of the VDD voltage (refer to the power-up and power-down sequence section) and must preferably be connected to VDD when these peripherals are not used.

*DAC minimum voltage is 1.71&nbsp;V without buffer and 1.8&nbsp;V with buffer. COMP and ADC minimum voltages are 1.62&nbsp;V. VREFBUF minimum voltage is 2.4&nbsp;V.*

- **VDDRF = 1.8&nbsp;Vto 3.6&nbsp;V**

VDDRF is an external power supply for the radio. It is provided externally through the VDDRF pin and must be connected to the same supply as VDD.

- **VBAT = 1.55&nbsp;Vto 3.6&nbsp;V**

VBAT is the power supply for RTC, TAMP, an external clock 32&nbsp;kHz oscillator, and backup registers (through a power switch) when VDD is not present.

- **VREF-, VREF+**

VREF+ is the input reference voltage for ADC and DAC. It is also the output of the internal voltage reference buffer when enabled.
   - When VDDA < 2&nbsp;V, VREF+ must be equal to VDDA.
   - When VDDA ≥ 2&nbsp;V, VREF+ must be between 2&nbsp;V and VDDA.

VREF+ can be grounded when ADC/DAC is not active. The internal voltage reference buffer supports the following output voltages, configured with VRS bit in the VREFBUF_CSR register:
   - VREF+ around 2.048&nbsp;V: this requires VDDA ≥ 2.4&nbsp;V.
   - VREF+ around 2.5&nbsp;V: this requires VDDA ≥ 2.8&nbsp;V.

**Power Up and Down Sequence**

During power up and power down, the following power sequence is required:
1.  When VDD < 1&nbsp;Vother, power supplies (VDDA) must remain below VDD + 300&nbsp;mV.
During power down, VDD can temporarily become lower than other supplies only if the energy provided to the device remains below 1&nbsp;mJ. This allows external decoupling capacitors to be discharged with different time constants during this transient phase.

2.  When VDD > 1&nbsp;V, all other power supplies (VDDA) become independent.
An embedded linear voltage regulator is used to supply the internal digital power VCORE. VCORE is the power supply for digital peripherals, SRAM1 and SRAM2. The Flash memory is supplied by VCORE and VDD. VCORE is split into two parts: a VDDO part and an interruptible part, VDDI.

  width="50%"
  caption="RAK3172-SiP Power Section"
/>

**VDDPA**

To transmit high output power up to + 22&nbsp;dBm, VDDPA must be supplied directly from VDD on the VDDSMPS pin, as shown in **Figure 11**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/application-note/vddpa.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="VDDPA Supply"
/>

The output power range is programmable in 32 steps of 1&nbsp;dB. The power amplifier ramping timing is also programmable. This allows adaptation to meet radio regulation requirements. The table below gives the maximum transmitter output power versus the VDDPA supply level.

| VDDPA Supply (V) | Transmit Output Power (dBm) |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| 3.3              | +22                         |
| 2.7              | +20                         |
| 2.4              | +19                         |
| 1.8              | +16                         |

### Power Supply Configurations

There are two different supply configurations, as shown in **Figure 12**.

1.  By the MCU using the SMPSEN setting in PWR control register 5 (PWR_CR5), which depends upon the MCU system operating mode (Run, Stop, Standby, or Shutdown).
2.  By the sub-GHz radio using SetRegulatorMode() command and the sub-GHz radio operating mode (Sleep, Calibrate, Standby, Standby with HSE32 or Active).

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak3172-sip/application-note/ldo_smps.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="LDO and SMPS configurations"
/>

**Power Supply Related Details**
- After any POR and NRST reset, the LDO mode is selected. The SMPS selection has priority over the LDO selection.
- While the sub-GHz radio is in Standby with HSE32 or in Active mode, the supply mode is not altered until the sub-GHz radio enters Standby or Sleep mode. The sub-GHz radioactivity may add a delay in entering the MCU software requested supply mode.
- The LDO or SMPS supply mode can be checked with the SMPSRDY flag in power status register 2 (PWR_SR2).
- When the radio is active, the supply mode is not changed until after the radioactivity is finished.
- During Stop 1, Stop 2, and Standby modes, when the sub-GHz radio is not active, the LDO or SMPS step-down converter is switched off. When exiting low-power modes (except Shutdown), the SMPS step-down converter is set by hardware to the mode selected by the SMPSEN bit in PWR control register 5 (PWR_CR5). SMPSEN is retained in Stop and Standby modes.
- Independently from the MCU software selected supply operating mode, the sub-GHz radio allows the supply mode selection while the sub-GHz radio is active (possible due to the sub-GHz radio *SetRegulatorMode()* command).
- The maximum load current delivered by the SMPS can be selected by the sub-GHz radio SUBGHZ_SMPSC2R register.
- The inrush current of the LDO and SMPS step-down converter can be controlled via the sub-GHz radio SUBGHZ_PCR register. This information is retained in all but the sub-GHz radio Deep-sleep mode.
- The SMPS needs a clock to be functional. If for any reason this clock stops, the device may be destroyed. To avoid this situation, a clock detection is used to, in case of a clock failure, switch off the SMPS and enable the LDO. The SMPS clock detection is enabled by the sub-GHz radio SUBGHZ_SMPSC0R.CLKDE. By default, the SMPS clock detection is disabled and must be enabled before enabling the SMPS.

:::warning ⚠️ WARNING
Before enabling the SMPS, the SMPS clock detection must be enabled in the Sub-GHz radio SUBGHZ_SMPSC0R.CLKDE.
:::

### Power Supply Supervisor

The module integrates a power-on reset/power-down reset, coupled with a Brownout reset (BOR) circuitry.

- **BOR (Brownout Reset)**
<br>
BOR0 level cannot be disabled. Other BOR levels can be enabled by the user option. When enabled, BOR is active in all power modes except in Shutdown. Five BOR thresholds can be selected through option bytes.

During power-on, BOR keeps the device under reset until the supply voltage VDD reaches the specified VBORx threshold: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • When VDD drops below the selected threshold, a device reset is generated. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • When VDD is above the VBORx upper limit, the device reset is released and the system can start.

- **PVD (Programmable Voltage Detector)**

The module features an embedded PVD (programmable voltage detector) that monitors the VDD power supply and compares it with the VPVD threshold. An interrupt can be generated when VDD drops below the VPVD threshold and/or when VDD is higher than the VPVD threshold. The interrupted service routine can then generate a warning message and/or put the MCU into a safe state.

The PVD is enabled by software and can be configured to monitor the VDD supply level needed for the sub-GHz radio operation. For this, the PVD must select its lowest threshold, and the PVD and the wakeup must be enabled by the EWPVD bit in the PWR_CR3 register.
Only a voltage drop below the PVD level generates a wakeup event.

- **PVM (Peripheral Voltage Monitor)**

The module features an embedded PVM (peripheral voltage monitor) that compares the independent supply voltage VDDA with a fixed threshold to ensure that the peripheral is in its functional supply range.

- **Radio End-Of-Life Monitor**

A radio end-of-life monitor provides information on the VDD supply when VDD is too low to operate the sub-GHz radio. When reaching the EOL level, the software must safely stop all radioactivity.

### Linear Voltage Regulator

Two embedded linear voltage regulators supply all the digital circuitries, except for the Standby circuitry and the Backup domain. The main regulator (MR) output voltage (VCORE) can be programmed by software to two different power ranges (range 1 and range 2), to optimize the consumption depending on the maximum operating frequency of the system.
The voltage regulators are always enabled after a reset. Depending on the application modes, the VCORE supply is provided either by the main regulator or by the low-power regulator (LPR).

When MR is used, a dynamic voltage scaling is proposed to optimize power as follows:
  - Range 1: High-performance range
      - The system clock frequency can be up to 48&nbsp;MHz.
      - The Flash memory access time for read access is minimum.
      - Write and erase operations are possible.

  - Range 2: Low-power range
      - The system clock frequency can be up to 16&nbsp;MHz.
      - The flash memory access time for read access is increased as compared to range 1.
      - Write and erase operations are possible.

### VBAT

- **VBAT Operation**

The VBAT pin is used to power the device VBAT domain (RTC, LSE, and backup registers) from an external battery, an external super-capacitor, or from VDD when neither an external battery nor an external super-capacitor is present. Three anti-tamper detection pins are available in VBAT mode. VBAT operation is automatically activated when VDD is not present.

An internal VBAT battery charging circuit is embedded and can be activated when VDD is present.

:::tip 📝 NOTE:
When the microcontroller is supplied only from VBAT, external interrupts, and RTC alarms/events do not exit it from VBAT operation.
:::

- **VBAT Battery Voltage Monitoring**

This embedded hardware feature allows the application to measure the VBAT battery voltage using the ADC VIN[14] input channel. As VBAT may be higher than VDDA, and thus outside the ADC input range, the VBAT pin is internally connected to a bridge divider by three. As a consequence, the converted digital value is one-third of the VBAT voltage.

### Low-Power Modes

The module supports several low-power modes to achieve the best compromise between low-power consumption, short startup time, available peripherals, and available wakeup sources. By default, the microcontroller is in Run mode, range 1, after a system or a power-on reset. It is up to the user to select one of the low-power modes described below:

- **Sleep Mode:**

CPU clock off, all peripherals including CPU core peripherals (among them NVIC, SysTick) can run and wake up the CPU when an interrupt or an event occurs.

- **Low-Power Run Mode (LPRun):**

When the system clock frequency is reduced below 2&nbsp;MHz, the code is executed from the SRAM or the Flash memory. The regulator is in low-power mode to minimize the operating current.

- **Low-Power Sleep Mode (LPSleep):**

Entered from the LPRun mode.

- **Stop 0 and Stop 1 Modes:**

The content of SRAM1, SRAM2, and all registers is retained. All clocks in the VCORE domain are stopped. PLL, MSI, HSI16, and HSE32 are disabled. LSI and LSE can be kept running. RTC can remain active (Stop mode with RTC, Stop mode without RTC). The sub-GHz radio may remain active independently from the CPU. Some peripherals with the wakeup capability can enable HSI16 RC during the Stop mode to detect their wakeup condition.

- **Stop 1 Mode:**

Stop 1 offers the largest number of active peripherals and wakeup sources, a smaller wakeup time but a higher consumption compared with Stop 2. In Stop 0 mode, the main regulator remains on, resulting in the fastest wakeup time but with much higher consumption. The active peripherals and wakeup sources are the same as in Stop 1 mode, which uses the low-power regulator. The system clock, when exiting Stop 0 or Stop 1 mode, can be either MSI up to 48&nbsp;MHz or HSI16, depending on the software configuration.

- **Stop 2 Mode:**

In Stop 2 mode, part of the VCORE domain is powered off. Only SRAM1, SRAM2, the CPU, and some peripherals preserve their contents. All clocks in the VCORE domain are stopped. PLL, MSI, HSI16, and HSE32 are disabled.

LSI and LSE can be kept running. RTC can remain active (Stop 2 mode with RTC, Stop 2 mode without RTC). The sub-GHz radio may also remain active independently of the CPU. Some peripherals with the wakeup capability can enable HSI16 RC during the Stop 2 mode to detect their wakeup condition.
The system clock when exiting from Stop 2 mode, can be either MSI up to 48&nbsp;MHz or HSI16, depending on the software configuration.

- **Standby Mode:**

VCORE domain is powered off. However, it is possible to preserve the SRAM2 content as detailed below: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Standby mode with SRAM2 retention when the RRS bit is set in the PWR control register 3 (PWR_CR3). In this case, SRAM2 is supplied by the low-power      regulator. Standby mode when the RRS bit is cleared in the PWR control register 3 (PWR_CR3). In this case, the main regulator and the low-power regulator are powered off. All clocks in the VCORE domain are stopped. PLL, MSI, HSI16, and HSE32 are disabled. LSI and LSE can be kept running. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • The RTC can remain active (Standby mode with RTC, Standby mode without RTC). The sub-GHz radio and the PVD may also remain active when enabled independently from the CPU. In Standby mode, the PVD selects its lowest level. The system clock, when exiting Standby modes, is MSI at 4&nbsp;MHz.

- **Shutdown Mode:**

VCORE domain is powered off. All clocks in the VCORE domain are stopped. PLL, MSI, HSI16, LSI, and HSE32 are disabled. LSE can be kept running. The system clock when exiting Shutdown mode is MSI at 4&nbsp;MHz. In this mode, the supply voltage monitoring is disabled and the product behavior is not guaranteed in case of a power voltage drop.

## Layout Guideline

- **Power Trace Management**
    - Power traces should be directly connected to the regulator outputs, and then add 4.7&nbsp;uF bypass capacitors close to the module on each power trace.
    - Never let the power trace cross the other one or the high-speed signal trace.

- **Ground Management**
    - Ensure (1) GND polygon regions used for the module are as complete as possible and (2) well-established GND via holes, to maintain good heat dissipation and RF performance.
    - The reference ground planes of RF trace need to add via holes and we recommend the distance between each adding ones less than 1/8&nbsp;λ.

- **RF Trace Management**
    - CPWG model is recommended for RF trace calculation since it has better EMC and RF capability. Also, discuss with the PCB manufacturer how to evaluate and keep the RF trace at 50&nbsp;Ω.
    - The recommended layout of the RF trace bend is to keep the same width in the corner.

      width="60%"
      caption="RF Trace"
    />

    - The values of a and b will affect each other, it is best to control it not to be too wide from the width and gap of the output pad of the module

      width="30%"
      caption="PCB RF Trace"
    />

- **RF Matching Circuit**

    - In Pi-matching circuits, it is advised to make it close to the LoRa antenna. For 50&nbsp;Ω matching Antenna application, connect 100&nbsp;pF at the RF-trace.

    <rk-img

      width="30%"
      caption="Pi-matching Circuit"
    />


    - If you choose a metal coil antenna, the impedance will be lower (<50&nbsp;Ω) and it is inductive. Its R+jL is easier to fall on the upper left of the Smith Chart, so series inductance and parallel capacitance are the chosen matching method, but sometimes for bandwidth consideration, multi-level matching is also used.

- **ESD Protection**
    - If used in a harsh ESD environment, the following example is the reference design for ESD Protection. The recommended part is **Semtech - Rclamp2451z (1-Line, 24&nbsp;V)**.

- **Shielding Cover**
    - Shielding Cover design is recommended for EMI suppression.
