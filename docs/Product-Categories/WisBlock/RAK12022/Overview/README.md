## Product Description

**RAK12022** is a PT100 IO module that uses **MAX31865**, an easy-to-use resistance-to-digital converter optimized for platinum resistance temperature detectors (RTDs). An external resistor sets the sensitivity for the RTD being used and a precision delta-sigma ADC converts the ratio of the RTD resistance to the reference resistance into digital form. The MAX31865‚Äôs inputs are protected against overvoltage faults as large as 45&nbsp;V. Programmable detection of RTD and cable open and short conditions is included.

## Product Features

**Module specifications**
- Based on MCP2518FD and ATA6563
- Compatible with 2-wire, 3-wire, and 4-wire sensor connections
- SPI-Compatible Interface
- 15-Bit ADC Resolution; Nominal Temperature Resolution 0.03125&nbsp;NC (Varies Due to RTD Nonlinearity)
- Total Accuracy Over All Operating Conditions: 0.5&nbsp;NC (0.05% of Full Scale) max
- Fully Differential VREF Inputs
- 21&nbsp;ms (max) Conversion Time
- Power supply: 3.3&nbsp;V
- Operating Temperature: -40¬∞&nbsp;C ~ 85¬∞&nbsp;C

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK12022**, you need a **WisBlock Base** board to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** board provides power supply to the **RAK12022** module. Furthermore, you need the **WisBlock Core** module to use the RAK12022.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Make sure to fix the module with screws to ensure proper function.
