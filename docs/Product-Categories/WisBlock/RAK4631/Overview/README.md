## Product Description

**RAK4631** is a **WisBlock Core** module for RAK **WisBlock**. It extends the **WisBlock** series with a powerful Nordic nRF52840 MCU that supports Bluetooth 5.0 (Bluetooth Low Energy) and the newest LoRa transceiver from Semtech, the SX1262. The Semtech SX1262 has compared to the older SX127x series a lower power consumption at the same TX power. This makes the **RAK4631** an ultra-low power communication solution.
**RAK4631** can be comfortably programmed with the Arduino‚Ñ¢ IDE or the PlatformIO extension for other IDE's like Atom, MS Visual Code, or Clion.

Both LoRaWAN and LoRa point-to-point connections are supported by an Arduino‚Ñ¢ library.

::: tip üìù NOTE
The RAK4631 and RAK4631-R share common hardware and are 100% identical, but their firmware is different. **RAK4631** firmware is based on the Arduino BSP of the nRF52840 chip, whereas **RAK4631-R** firmware is based on RUI V3, giving you the flexibility to develop optimized firmware using the [RUI3 APIs](/RUI3/Arduino-API/) or via [RUI3 AT commands](/RUI3/Serial-Operating-Modes/AT-Command-Manual/).

You can [convert your RAK4631 to RAK4631-R](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/DFU/#updating-rak4631-to-rui3) if you prefer [RUI3](/RUI3/).

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK4631**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** is the power supply for the **RAK4631** module and has the programming/debug interface.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Make sure to fix the module with the screws to ensure a proper function.
- When using the LoRa or Bluetooth Low Energy transceivers, make sure that always an antenna is connected. Using these transceivers without an antenna can damage the system.
