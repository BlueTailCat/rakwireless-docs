# RAK7391 WisGate Connect Assembly Guide

## Indoor Rack Enclosure

1. Install the CM4 module. The module does not need to be fixed with screws but it is recommended.

4. Pass the RF cable/connector through the circular openings in the shell and fix it with the washer and nut. Make sure the pigtails are long enough and that the connector polarity matches the polarity of your antenna (SMA/RP-SMA). If such connectors are not required for your setup, simply plug the openings with the provided rubber plugs.

:::tip üìù NOTE
The diameter of the pole that is supported by the brackets is 50-100 mm. If the pole diameter is more than this value, steel strips can be used. The standard mounting kit does not include steel strips. If needed, this may be purchased separately.
:::

3. Hang up the enclosure and fasten it with two M6*12 screws.

### Connecting the PoE Adapter

1. Connect the Ethernet cable from the enclosure to the Ethernet port labeled POE on the adapter.
2. Connect an Ethernet cable from your LAN network to the Ethernet port labeled LAN on the adapter.
3. Connect one end of the power cord to the adapter. Connect the other end of the power cord to a power outlet.

### Weather Protection

To better protect the Ethernet cable gland and the antenna connector from the weather, you need to cover them with PVC tape.

1. Clean the surface area of the connector that will be wrapped. Wrap a layer of PVC tape with a 50% overlap according to the rotation direction of the connector. Continue wrapping the PVC tape to about 10&nbsp;mm below the end of the connector.

2. Cut off about 50&nbsp;cm of waterproof tape. Stretch it to double the length. Wrap three layers around the connector with a 50% overlap. Hold the tape in place with your hand for a few seconds.

3. Wrap three additional layers with PVC tape with natural uncoiling force and a 50% overlap. Make sure to cover the head and the tail of the connector.
