# RAK9154 Solar Battery Installation Guide

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The diameter of the pole that is supported by the brackets is 55-80&nbsp;mm. If the pole diameter is more than this value, larger steel strips can be used. The standard mounting kit does not include larger steel strips. If needed, it should be purchased separately.
:::

1. Fix the mounting bracket on the pole with two steel strips.
