## Product Configuration

### Overview

To give you a better understanding of how the RAK5811 Module works, the block diagram is provided in this section.

#### Block Diagram

In the RAK5811 module, as shown in **Figure 1**, the 0-5&nbsp;V input signal is connected to the operational amplifier by the R1/R2 voltage divider. The operational amplifier output is routed to an analog input of the MCU to be digitalized by an internal ADC.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5811/quickstart/rak5811-block-diagram.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="RAK5811 Block Diagram"
/>

Once the signal is digitalized, you can recover the original voltage value by applying the following relation:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5811/quickstart/voltage-divider.png"
  width="25%"
  caption="RAK5811 Voltage divider relation"
/>

Where Vout is the WisBlock Core read voltage, Vin is the analog input voltage (0-5&nbsp;V). From the voltage divider R1 is 1&nbsp;MŒ© and R2 is 1.5&nbsp;MŒ©, so the final relationship is: **Vin = Vout / 0.6**.

As shown in **Figure 1**, the module provides an output of 12&nbsp;V to power industrial sensors. This 12&nbsp;V output is controlled by a TPS60146 DC-DC booster. The **Enable** pin allows to control the output voltage of the booster module and sets the RAK5811 module into a low power consumption mode.

### Hardware Setup

#### Installation

##### Mounting Mechanism

The RAK5811 module is part of the WisBlock Interface category, which connects to the baseboard through the IO slot. Execute the following instructions carefully to install your WisConnector into the Baseboard:

1. Keep the RAK5811 module parallel to the baseboard, and gently place and plug WisConnector into the IO slot receptacle of the baseboard. The IO slot has an outer silkscreen on it to assist with the alignment. At this point, apply force evenly along with the module and press again. There will be a sound to confirm the successful completion of the attachment process.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
For detailed instructions, refer to the [WisBlock Installation Guide](/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/).

##### RAK5811 Fast Crimping Terminal Mechanism

The RAK5811 features a fast-crimping terminal connector to simplify and ensure the wiring process on the fields. The fast-crimping terminal can support cable with a width between 20 AWG to 24 AWG. The usual stripping length is around 6 to 7&nbsp;mm.

As shown in **Figure 5**, during the crimping process, you should first press down and maintain the spring head of the crimping terminal firmly, then insert the stripped cable head into the corresponding connector‚Äôs hole. Once inserted correctly, release the spring head, and the crimping process is completed.

:::

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- Battery can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause fire.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the RAK WisBlock Base Board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
:::

### Software Configuration and Example

#### Arduino Setup

The RAK5811 module includes a 12&nbsp;V voltage source which is controlled by the WisBlock Core module via the **Enable** pin of the WisBlock Base. This GPIO must be set to **HIGH** before sampling. The 12&nbsp;V voltage source is also designed to provide the power supply to the operational amplifier of the module. Before connecting a sensor to the RAK5811 module, you must be sure that the sensor can safely operate at 5&nbsp;V.

If you already installed the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index), the WisBlock Core and example code should now be available on the Arduino IDE.

1. First, you need to select the WisBlock Core you have, as shown in **Figure 9** to **Figure 11**.

- The **`analogOversampling`** is a method to achieve a higher resolution without using an external ADC.

```c{2,3}
pinMode(WB_A1, INPUT_PULLDOWN);
analogReference(AR_INTERNAL_3_0);
analogOversampling(128);
```
##### 1.3 Get ADC Samples
- At the end of sampling, the sketch calculates the average ADC.
```c
for (i = 0; i < NO_OF_SAMPLES; i++)
{
    mcu_ain_raw += analogRead(WB_A1);
}
average_raw = mcu_ain_raw / i;
```
##### 1.4 Process ADC Samples

- Calculate raw voltage based on ADC reference and resolution
- Reduce input signal to 6/10

```c
mcu_ain_voltage = average_raw * 3.0 / 1024;   // ref 3.0V / 10bit ADC

voltage_sensor = mcu_ain_voltage / 0.6;     // WisBlock RAK5811 (0 ~ 5V).   Input signal reduced to 6/10 a

depths = (voltage_sensor * 1000 - 574) * 2.5;   //Convert to millivolt. 574mv is the default output from sensor

Serial.printf("-------average_value------ = %d\n", average_raw);
Serial.printf("-------voltage_sensor------ = %f\n", voltage_sensor);
Serial.printf("-------depths------ = %d mm\n", depths);
```

- The function **`analogReadResolution`** set the size (bits) of the ADC. The default value is 12-bit resolution.

```c{1,2,3}
adcAttachPin(WB_A1);
analogSetAttenuation(ADC_11db);
analogReadResolution(12);
```
##### 1.3 Get ADC Samples
- At the end of sampling, the sketch calculates the average ADC.
```c
for (i = 0; i < NO_OF_SAMPLES; i++)
{
    adc_raw += analogRead(sensor_pin);
}
average_adc_raw = adc_raw / NO_OF_SAMPLES;
```


##### 1.4 Process ADC Samples

- The function **`esp_adc_cal_raw_to_voltage(average_adc_raw)`** convert adc_raw value to voltage in mV.

```c{1}
voltage_mcu_ain = esp_adc_cal_raw_to_voltage(average_adc_raw);
voltage_sensor = voltage_mcu_ain / 0.6;   //WisBlock RAK5811 (0 ~ 5V). Input signal reduced to 6/10 and output
depths = (voltage_sensor * 1000 - 574) * 2.5; //Convert to millivolt. 574mv is the default V output from sensor
```
