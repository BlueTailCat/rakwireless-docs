# RAK12059 Quick Start Guide


## Prerequisite

### What Do You Need?

Before going through each and every step on using the RAK12059 WisBlock Liquid Level Sensor Module, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

#### Hardware

- [RAK12059 WisBlock Liquid Level Sensor Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-water-level-sensor-rak12059?utm_source=RAK12059&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)

- Your choice of [WisBlock Core](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core?utm_source=WisBlockCore&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
- USB Cable
- [Li-Ion/LiPo Battery (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/battery-connector-cable?utm_source=BatteryConnector&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
- [Solar Charger (optional)](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-accessory/products/solar-panel-connector-cable?utm_source=SolarPanelConnector&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)

#### Software

- Download and install [Arduino IDE.](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- To add the RAKwireless Core boards to your Arduino Boards Manager, install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP.](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index)

## Product Configuration

### Hardware Setup

The WisBlock Sensor RAK12059 is a liquid-level measurement sensor. It uses MILONE's proprietary eTape sensor products with different active lengths. For more information about RAK12059, refer to the [Datasheet](../Datasheet/).

The RAK12059 WisBlock Liquid Level Sensor Module can be mounted on the sensor slots of the WisBlock Base board, as shown in **Figure 1**. It will work on SLOT A, C, D, E and F. Also, always secure the connection of the WisBlock module by using compatible screws.

#### Assembling and Disassembling of WisBlock Modules

##### Assembling

As shown in **Figure 2**, the location for the sensors slots are properly marked by silkscreen. Follow carefully the procedure defined in [WisBlock Base board assembly/disassembly instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/RAK5005-O-Baseboard-Installation-Guide/) to attach a WisBlock module. Once attached, carefully fix the module with three pieces of M1.2 x 3&nbsp;mm screws.

  width="70%"
  caption="RAK12059 assembly to WisBlock Base"
/>

##### Disassembling

The procedure for disassembling any type of WisBlock module is the same.

1. To begin disassembling, remove the screws.

  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak12059/quickstart/removing_screw.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="Removing screws from the WisBlock module"
/>

2. After removing the screws, check the silkscreen of the module to find the correct location where force can be applied.

3. Detach the module from the base board by applying forcer to the module at the position of the connector, as shown in **Figure 5**.

::: tip üìù NOTE
- If you will connect other modules to the remaining WisBlock Base slots, check on the [WisBlock Pin Mapper](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Knowledge-Hub/Pin-Mapper/). This tool finds possible pin conflicts.
:::

After all this setup, you can now connect the battery (optional) and USB cable to start programming your WisBlock Core.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
- Batteries can cause harm if not handled properly.
- Only 3.7-4.2&nbsp;V rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. It is highly recommended not to use other types of batteries with the system unless you know what you are doing.
- If a non-rechargeable battery is used, it has to be unplugged first before connecting the USB cable to the USB port of the board to configure the device. Not doing so might damage the battery or cause a fire.
- Only 5&nbsp;V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12&nbsp;V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and, eventually, other electronic parts.
- Make sure the battery wires match the polarity on the WisBlock Base board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.

### Software Configuration and Example

In this example, you will monitor the level of the liquid where the MILONE eTape probe is submerged. The eTape sensor data will be captured by the ADC chip of RAK12059 module then accessed by WisBlock Core via I2C interface.

#### Initial Test of the RAK12059 WisBlock Module

1. Install the [RAKwireless Arduino BSP](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index) for WisBlock by using the `package_rakwireless_index.json` board installation package. The WisBlock Core should now be available on the Arduino IDE.

2. After that, you need to select the WisBlock Core you have, as shown in **Figure 6** to **Figure 8**.

5. After successful installation of the library, you can now select the right serial port and upload the code, as shown in **Figure 11** and **Figure 12**.

::: tip üìù NOTE:
RAK11200 requires the BOOT0 pin to be configured properly before uploading. If not done properly, uploading the source code to RAK11200 will fail. Check the full details on the [RAK11200 Quick Start Guide](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK11200/Quickstart/#uploading-to-wisblock).
