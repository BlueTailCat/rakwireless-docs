## Product Description

RAK13010 is a WisBlock Interface module that extends the WisBlock system. The SDI-12 (Serial Digital Interface at 1200 baud rate) module is an asynchronous serial communications protocol for intelligent sensors that monitor environment data. It consists of 3 wires: **SDI-12_12V**, **SDI-12_DATA**, and **GND**.

The SDI-12 bus is a bidirectional interface for the conversion of commands and data into UART to SDI-12 and vice versa using a 3.3&nbsp;V microcontroller. The data logger requests data from the intelligent sensors, each identified with a unique address. In short, The data logger is the master, and the sensors are slave devices on the bus. The RAK13010 makes it easier for you to connect wires from multiple SDI-12 sensors into one set of terminals on a data logger.
