## Product Description

RAK7432/RAK7434 WisNode Bridge Analogs are analog to LoRaWAN converters designed for industrial applications. These can read values from devices supporting the current loop.

RAK7432/RAK7434 can operate in all of the LoRaWAN bands within the standard parameters defined by the LoRa Alliance. Their line of sight range is 15+&nbsp;km and in industrial cases, where there are heavy obstructions in the path of the RF signal performance is improved compared to conventional wireless systems due to the characteristics of LoRa as a modulation technique. This allows for consistently good signal quality within large factories, densely populated offices, storehouses, etc.

Together with the RAK gateway and LoRa Server products, they can easily and quickly build a wireless industrial system or extend an already existing one. They adopt industrial protection design, support a wide range voltage supply supports wall mounting and DIN rail installation and facilitates field installation and use.
