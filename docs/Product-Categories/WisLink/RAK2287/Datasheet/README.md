## Specifications

### Overview

The overview shows the top and back views of the RAK2287 board. It also presents the block diagram that discusses how the board works.

#### Board Overview

The RAK2287 is a compact LPWAN Gateway Module, making it suitable for integration in systems where mass and size constraints are essential. It has been designed with the PCI Express Mini Card form factor in mind, so it can easily become a part of products that comply with the standard, where they allow cards with a thickness of at least 10.5&nbsp;mm.

The board has two UFL interfaces for the LoRa and GNSS antennas and a standard 52-pin connector (mPCIe).

#### Block Diagram

The RAK2287 card is equipped with one SX1302 chip and two SX1250 chips. The SX1302 chip is used for RF signal processing and serves as the core of the device, while the SX1250 chips handle the related LoRa modem and processing functionalities. Additional signal conditioning circuitry is implemented to comply with the PCI Express Mini Card standard, and one UFL connector is provided for the integration of external antennas.

### Hardware

The hardware is categorized into seven (7) parts. It discusses the interfacing, pinouts and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the parameters and standard values of the board.

#### Interface

##### Power Supply

The RAK2287 card must be powered through the 3.3 Vaux pins by a DC power supply. It is crucial that the voltage remains stable, as the current drawn can vary significantly during operation, depending on the power consumption profile of the SX1302 chip. For more detailed information, refer to the [SX1302 Datasheet](https://www.mouser.com/pdfDocs/Semtech_08072019_DS_SX1302_V10-1626824.pdf).

##### SPI Interface

SPI interface mainly provides for the Host_SCK, Host_MISO, Host_MOSI, Host_CSN pins of the system connector. The SPI interface gives access to the configuration register of SX1302 via a synchronous full-duplex protocol. Only the slave side is implemented.

##### UART and I2C Interface

The RAK2287 integrates a ZOE-M8Q GPS module, which supports both UART and I2C interfaces. The pins on the golden finger provide connections for UART and I2C, allowing direct access to the GPS module. The PPS (Pulse Per Second) signal is connected internally to the SX1302, as well as to the golden finger, making it available for use by the host board.

##### GPS_PPS

The RAK2287 card includes the GPS_PPS input for received packets time-stamped.

##### RESET

The RAK2287 card includes the RESET active-high input signal to reset the radio operations as specified by the SX1302 Specification.

##### Antenna RF Interface

The modules have one RF interface over a standard UFL connector (Hirose U. FL-R-SMT) with a characteristic impedance of 50&nbsp;Ω. The RF port (J1) supports both Tx and Rx, providing the antenna interface.

#### Electrical Requirements

Exceeding one or more of the limits specified in the Absolute Maximum Rating section may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only. Operating the module under these conditions, or any conditions other than those specified in the Operating Conditions section of the specifications, should be avoided. Prolonged exposure to Absolute Maximum Rating conditions may affect the device's reliability.

The operating condition range defines the limits within which the functionality of the device is guaranteed. While application information is provided, it is advisory only and does not form part of the specification.

::: tip 📝 NOTE
Although this module is designed to be as robust as possible, electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage this module. This module must be protected at all times from ESD when handling or transporting. Static charges may easily produce potentials of several kilovolts on the human body or equipment, which can discharge without detection. Industry-standard ESD handling precautions should be used at all times.
