# RAK11721 AT Command Manual

## Overview

RAK11721 is based on the Ambiq Apollo3 Blue AMA3B1KK-KBR-B0 SoC MCU and Semtech LoRa transceiver SX1262. It is designed to simplify LoRaWAN and LoRa point-to-point (P2P) communication. It also features BLE functionality of the Apollo3 Blue chip. To integrate LoRa technology into your projects, the RAK11721 is implemented with an easy-to-use Serial Port communication interface where you can send AT commands. Through these AT commands, you can set the parameters needed for LoRa P2P and LoRaWAN communication.

## RUI3 AT Command List

The RAK11721 default firmware is based on [RUI3 (RAKwireless Unified Interface V3)](/RUI3/#overview). You can access the AT command via UART0 by default.

The complete list of commands can be found in [RUI3 AT Commands Documentation](/RUI3/Serial-Operating-Modes/AT-Command-Manual/#content).
